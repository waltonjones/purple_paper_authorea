MiRNA screening reveals that purple expression in fat body is critical for appetite control
(A) Flowchart explaining screening process. (B) Schematic diagram of modified CAFE assay. (C) Summary of miRNA overexpression screening. Gray dots represent each UAS-miR lines tested. #lines showed increased feeding (fold change > 1) and # lines showed decreased feeding (fold change < 1). [[ Need explanation for corrected significance threshold]]. Among flies showed increased feeding, miR-iab-4 showed the lowest p-value (0.00##)    See Suh 2015 for the line information. (D)Increased feeding from adult fat body specific miR-iab-4 overexpression. Gray dots represent each CAFE data (n = 20, 15, and 11 as top to bottom) (E)
