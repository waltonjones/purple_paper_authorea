(A) Flowchart explaining screening process. (B) Schematic diagram of modified CAFE assay. (C) Summary of miRNA overexpression screening. Gray dots represent each UAS-miR lines tested. See Suh 2015 for the line information. (D)Increased feeding from adult fat body specific miR-iab-4 overexpression. Gray dots represent each CAFE data (n = 20, 15, and 11 as top to bottom) (E)
