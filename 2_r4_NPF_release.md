Our data suggests that BH4 in NPF Neuron is important to regulate feeding amount. But that does not mean NPF hormone is the target of BH4. NPF, homologous to mammalian NPY, is known to involved in larval feeding and adult sweet taste sensation \cite{Wu_2003, Inagaki_2014}, but its action on adult ad lib feeding has never been tested. To investigate whether NPF signaling is involved in the control of feeding amount, we knockdown NPF gene in NPF neuron and test the changes of appetite behavior. We observed that NPF knockdown shows decreased feeding (Fig. 4a). The result was consistent with the appetite behavior of NPF receptor mutant files (Fig.  4b). To confirm that the involvement of NPF signal in BH4 action, we knockdown Sptr gene on NPF neuron under NPFR mutant background. When NPF signal is impaired by receptor mutation, Sptr knockdown does not induce hyperphagia, suggesting that NPF is the target of BH4 (Fig. 4c). 

In previous research, BH4 is involved in biochemical reactions to generate Nitric oxide (NO), tyrosine, dopamine, serotonin, and ether lipids \cite{Werner_2011, Kim_2015}. To investigate whether these reactions happen in NPF neurons to regulate appetite behavior, we test knockdown of genes for NO, tyrosine, dopamine, and serotonin synthesis. We did not observe any changes in appetite behavior (Extended Data Fig. 6). We could not test the possibility of ether lipids because homological gene for enzyme (alkylglycerol mono-oxygenase, AGMO) is not known in Drosophila. 

BH4 is known as a cofactor, which helps the reaction. However, our data suggests that high BH4 mimics the less eating phenotype of NPF knockdown. To verify the effect of BH4 on NPF change, we feed high dose of BH4 and stained NPF neurons with NPF antibody. We found that relatively low NPF staining from Sptr-knockdown animals. Interestingly, same genotype flies show extremely high staining after BH4 feeding (Fig. 4d,e). These changes in NPF levels were not from changes in NPF gene expressions (Fig. 4f). This data imply that high BH4 inhibits the release of NPF from cell body. More interestingly, activation of NPF neuron by the expression of bacterial sodium channel, NaChBac, negates the effect of BH4 even in high dose (Fig. 4g). When the NPF neurons are constitutively active, BH4 NPF intensity does not change too even after BH4 feeding (Extended Data Fig 7). This data suggests BH4 involved in inactivation of NPF neuron, so NPF would not released.
