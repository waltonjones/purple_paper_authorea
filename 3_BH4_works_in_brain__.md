3. BH4 works in brain, not in fat body for feeding

The terminal reaction in the biosynthesis of BH4 requires Sepiapterin Reductase, which is generated from gene Sptr (Figure 2A). We investigated ad lib feeding of Sptr mutant flies. As expected, Sptr mutants also showed hyperphagia, which is rescuable by BH4 pre-feeding (Figure 3A). We hypothesized that pr over-expression on fat body may not rescue hyperphagia of Sptr mutant because Sptr is downstream of pr in the process of BH4 biosynthesis. Consistent with our hypothesis, adult specific over-expression of pr on fat body does not reduce feeding amount when the flies have Sptr mutant background, even though same pr over-expression showed decreased feeding in normal condition (Figure 3B and S3A). 

Next, we investigated Sptr knockdown on fat body to verify its effect on appetite behavior. To our surprise, we did not observe any increases in feeding from three different Sptr-IR lines. We also observed normal feeding behavior from Sptr knockdown using other fat body driver FB-Gal4(Figure S3B). We test Dhfr knockdown, which is known to involve in salvage pathway of BH4 biosynthesis (Figure S3C), but it was also normal (Figure S3D). We observed hyperphagia using whole-body driver Act5C-Gal4 (Figure S4A), meaning that knockdown itself is effective. Next, we tried pan-neuronal driver elav-Gal4 because appetite behavior is controlled by neurons after all. Surprisingly, Sptr knockdown in whole neuron showed increased feeding (Figure 3D and S3E). Peptidergic neuronal driver 386Y-Gal4 also showed increased feeding (Figure 3E). Since pr knockdown on brain does not show increased feeding (Figure 3F), we concluded that pr expression and Sptr expression are supposed to happen in two different places as in fat body and in brain for the regulation of appetite behavior.

We tested involvement of of eye on the process, but Sptr knockdown on eyes did not show the phenotype (Figure S3F)
