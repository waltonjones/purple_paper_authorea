Extended Data Figure 2 Fat body specific knockdown of BH4 related genes cause increased feeding and high resistance to starvation.

**a,** Increased feeding from fat body specific Pu knockdown (n = 25). **b,** and **c,** Survival rates upon starvation: Fat body specific pr or Pu knockdown shows more resistant upon starvation (**b**, n = 50, **c**, n = 60).
