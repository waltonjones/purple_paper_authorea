Fly strains
Flies were kept at 25oC or 18oC on common cornmeal-yeast-sucrose food under light:dark cycles and 60% humidity. A library of UAS-miR lines generated in our lab described previously (Suh, 2015). To generate UAS-pr, UAS-Sptr, each ORF sequence amplified via PCR and inserted into pUASTattB vector. The resulting constructs were microinjected for site-specific insertion on chromosome 2L or 3L using standard method. The following flies used in this study were previously described: S1106-Gal4(2001), FB-Gal4(2003), TH-Gal4(2003), Trh-Gal4(2010), TPH-Gal4(2012), c673a-Gal4(2009), Dilp2-Gal4(2002), sNPF-Gal4(2009), AstA-Gal4(2015 under revision).
The following flies were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center: Canton-S(1), w1118(5905), pr1(370), prG3141(27097), r4-Gal4(33832), tubp-Gal80ts (7018, 7019), PBac{WH}Sptrf04272(18753), Elav-Gal4(8760), 386Y-Gal4(25410), GMR-Gal4(1104), NPF-Gal4(25681), Act5C-Ga4(4414), OK72-Gal4(6486), NPFRMI08636(52133), NPFRc01896(10747), UAS-NaChBac(9466), UAS-Pu-IR1(41998) UAS-pr-IR2(53346), UAS-Sptr-IR1(28968), UAS-Sptr-IR2(43277), UAS-Dhfr-IR(35015), UAS-NPF-IR(27237), UAS-Nos-IR2(28792), UAS-Trh-IR2(25842), UAS-ple-IR2(25796), UAS-Hn-IR2(29540).
The following flies were obtained from VDRC stock center: UAS-Pu-IR2(v107296), UAS-pr-IR1(v109430), UAS-Sptr-IR3(v17017), UAS-Nos-IR1(v108433), UAS-Trh-IR1(v105414), UAS-ple-IR1(v108879), UAS-Hn-IR1(v110511).


Capillary Feeder assay and Drug feeding
To assess ad libitum adult fly feeding, we used a modiﬁed capillary feeder (CAFE) assay (Ja et al., 2007) with modification as followed: we transfer two 5-day old male ﬂies to a standard ﬂy vial containing only a wet Kimwipe. We then introduce a calibrated 20 µl capillary ﬁlled with 5% sucrose solution as the only food source. We allow the ﬂies to acclimate for 24 hours before starting the experiment. The next day, we reﬁll the capillary and allow the flies to feed over the course of 32 hours before measuring the total consumption at 19:00 the following day.
For RU486 feeding, we starved 4-day old males for 24hr with water only followed by RU486 (mifepristone;Sigma) mixed 5% sucrose solution for 24 hr. Final RU486 concentration was 0.01 M. After RU486 feeding, 32 hr CAFE test was followed.
For BH4 feeding, we used BH4-mixed 5% sucrose solution during 24hr acclimation and changed the capillary with a new capillary with normal 5% sucrose solution for the test. BH4-mixed 5% sucrose solution was made freshly for every experiment.


Immunohistochemistry and intensity measurement
Dissection and staining followed normal staining method in Vosshall lab (http://vosshall.rockefeller.edu/protocols/StockerFlyProt.pdf). Primary NPF antibody (0.05μg/μl, RayBiotech: RB-19-001) and secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000, Life technologies: Alexa Fluor 488) were used. LSM780 high sensitivity laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) with 20x objective (Olympus) was used to obtain confocal serial optical sections. For intensity measurement, each z-stack confocal pictures were opened in Image J and the intensity of each cell body was measured and calculated as 0(no staining) to 100(saturation). After then, the average intensity of each experimental group was calculated.


Quantitative RT–PCR analysis. 
RNA was extracted from whole bodies of 20 adult flies. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Real Time PCR was performed using the Bio-Rad CFX96TM Real Time System (Bio-Rad, USA). Rp49 was used as standards. Primers (5’ to 3’) used were as follows: 
NPF-F: GATGCCTACAAGTTCCTGCAGG; NPF-R: GTGACGTTGCCATGGTCGT; Rp49-F: ATGACCATCCGCCCAGCATA; Rp49-R: GAGAACGCAGGCGACCGTTG.



Starvation resistance assay
Starvation resistance assay was performed by the standard technique (Soderberg et al., 2015) with minor modification as follows: we placed two adult male flies (age 6-8 days) in a standard ﬂy vial containing only a wet Kimwipe, which provided water.



TAG assay
For TAG assays, 18 adult male flies of each genotype were homogenized and followed standard protocol (Palanker et al., 2009) using DU 730 Spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, USA). TAG amount were determined by subtracting the amount of free glycerol in the PBS-treated sample from the total glycerol present in the sample treated with Triglyceride reagent (Serum Triglyceride Determination Kit; Sigma TR0100). TAG levels were normalized to protein amounts in each homogenate using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).



Metabolic rate measurement
Measurement of metabolic rate using CO2 production was performed by standard technique (Yatsenko et al., 2014) with modification as follows: we used three of 7-day old males in a 2ml centrifuge tube as fly container with soda lime (Wako Inc., Japan). And 20μl Marienfeld capillary tube (Germany) was connected to the container with rubber cap. Container with no flies was used for blank. Blue-colored water was loaded at the tip of capillary and wait 30min for equilibration. Movement of water position for the next 1 hour was measured as CO2 generation.



Statistics
Boxplots in this study follow the standard style. For the multiple comparisons, we performed a one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise t-tests using the Bonferroni method to adjust the P value threshold for significance. Regarding the barplots in Fig. 5E, we present the mean ± s.e.m. and make comparisons between groups using the Student’s t-test considering _P_<0.05 as statistically significant (*** _p_<0.001, ** _p_<0.01, *_p_<0.05)
