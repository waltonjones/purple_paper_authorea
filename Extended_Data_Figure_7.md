Extended Data Figure 7 BH4 feeding does not make changes in NPF intensity in constitutively active NPF neurons

**a,** NPF antibody staining on brains of NPF specific NaChBac expression flies with or without BH4 feeding. Arrowheads indicate NPF cell bodies. Some of NPF>NaChBac brains showed undetectably low staining in some NPF cell bodies. **b,** Comparison between intensities of NPF stained cell bodies. 10-11 NPF cell bodies (4 brains) from each group used for intensity comparison.
