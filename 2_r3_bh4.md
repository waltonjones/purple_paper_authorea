Since we were able to confirm that the role *pr* plays in feeding is dependent on its expression in the fat body and not the eye, we explored the only other known function of *pr*, as a catalyst for one step in the synthesis of the enzymatic cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).
In this pathway, Punch or GTP cyclohydrolase converts GTP to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H<sub>2</sub>-NTP).
Purple (PTPS) then converts H<sub>2</sub>-NTP to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PTP), and Sepiapterin reductase (Sptr) converts the PTP to BH4 (Fig. 3A) \cite{Werner_2011}. 
To explore functional correlation between *pr* and BH4, we monitored *ad libitum* feeding of *pr* mutants after fed BH4-mixed sucrose solution during habituation (Fig. 3B). 
When we measured *ad libitum* feeding after fed low amount of BH4 (0.17 mg/ml), feeding amount of *pr* mutant flies were decreased almost same as controls in normal condition. 
The amount of feeding in controls also decreased after BH4 feeding, but the degree was negligible. 
After fed high amount of BH4 (0.34 mg/ml), all mutants and control flies showed decreased feeding and *pr* mutant flies consumed similarly low amount of sucrose as control. 
Low amount of BH4 feeding also rescued hyperphagia of r4-Gal4>UAS-pr-IR1 flies (Fig. 3C), supporting BH4 is involved in appetite regulation.

To confirm the function of BH4 in appetite control, we test knockdown of gene *Punch* (*Pu*) in fat body, which is upstream gene of *pr* in BH4 synthesis. 
Using two different RNAi lines, we found that *Pu* knockdown showed similar hyperphagia as *pr* knockdown (Fig. 3D and S1A). 
Increased feeding of *Pu* knockdown was rescued by BH4 feeding (Fig. 3D). 
The terminal reaction in the biosynthesis of BH4 requires Sepiapterin Reductase (Sptr). 
To test the downsteam of pr, we checked appetite behavior of *Sptr* mutant flies, which also showed increased feeding and rescued by BH4 pre-feeding (Fig. 3E). 
After we observed increased feeding phenotype from *Sptr* mutant flies, We hypothesized that *pr* over-expression on fat body may not rescue hyperphagia of *Sptr* mutant because Sptr is downstream of Pr in the process of BH4 biosynthesis. 
Consistent with our hypothesis, adult specific over-expression of *pr* on fat body does not reduce feeding amount when the flies have *Sptr* mutant background, even though same *pr* over-expression showed decreased feeding in normal background condition (Fig. 3F).
