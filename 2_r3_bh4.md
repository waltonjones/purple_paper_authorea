Since we were able to confirm that the role *pr* plays in feeding is dependent on its expression in the fat body and not the eye, we explored the only other known function of the Purple protein, as an enzymatic catalyst for an intermediate step in the synthesis of the enzymatic cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).
In this pathway, Punch or GTP cyclohydrolase converts GTP to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H<sub>2</sub>-NTP).
Purple (PTPS) then converts H<sub>2</sub>-NTP to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PTP), and Sepiapterin reductase (Sptr) converts the PTP to BH4 (Fig. 3A) \cite{Werner_2011}. 
Since Kwak et al. showed that oral BH4 can rescue the behavioral phenotypes associated with loss-of-function Sepiapterin reductase mutations in mice \cite{Kwak_2013}, we reduced the effective per weight doses for mice for use in *Drosophila*.
Specifically, we chose two BH4 doses, one low (0.17 mg/ml) and one high (0.34 mg/ml).
By adding the BH4 to the 5% sucrose solution in the capillaries of the CAFE assay only during the acclimation phase prior to any feeding measurements, we can discount the effect the taste of BH4 may have on the results.
We found that this BH4 pre-feeding produces a dose-dependent reduction in total feeding amount in all genotypes tested, but the effect is much stronger in the hypomorphic *pr* mutants *pr<sup>1</sup>* and *pr<sup>G3141</sup>* than in the "wild-type" controls *w<sup>1118</sup>* and Canton-S (Fig. 3B).
Pre-feeding with the low BH4 dose also fully rescues the increase in feeding caused by fat body-specific knock-down of *pr* (Fig. 3C).

For further evidence that the regulation of feeding by *pr* is dependent on its role in the production of BH4, we next asked whether loss-of-function of the other genes involved in BH4 synthesis can replicate the *pr* loss-of-function phenotype.
Indeed, we found that fat body-specific knock-down of *Punch* (*Pu*) using two different Pu-IR lines induces hyperphagia (Fig. 3D and S1A).
Just like that caused by the knock-down of *pr*, the hyperphagia caused by loss of Pu in the fat body is rescued by pre-feeding with low dose BH4 (Fig. 3D). 
The final step in the biosynthesis of BH4 is catalyzed by Sepiapterin Reductase (Sptr). 
Thus, we next measured the appetite of the hypomorphic *Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>* mutant strain.
We found that *Sptr* mutants eat more than *w<sup>1118</sup>* flies, but that this increase in appetite is rescued by pre-feeding with low dose BH4 (Fig. 3E). 
We then reasoned that if Pr acts upstream of Sptr with regard to this feeding phenotype, over-expression of *pr* in the adult fat body should not rescue the hyperphagia of *Sptr* mutants. 
To confirm this hypothesis, we used the ubiquitous temperature-sensitive GAL80 to limit the over-expression of *pr* to the adult fat body in both the *w<sup>1118</sup>* and *Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>* genetic backgrounds.
At 18ºC, while GAL80 is active and *pr* is not being over-expressed, we did not observe any difference between the experimental lines and their corresponding heterozygous controls (Fig. 3F, above).
In flies shifted to 30ºC post-eclosion, however, over-expression of *pr* in the fat body reduces the feeding of *w<sup>1118</sup>* flies but not *Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>* flies (Fig. 3F, below).
