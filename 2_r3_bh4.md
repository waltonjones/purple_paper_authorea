## Appetite regulation requires BH4
Since we confirmed that normal appetite regulation requires _pr_ in the fat body rather than in the eye, the feeding phenotype is unlikely related to the role the Purple protein plays in drosopterin eye pigment synthesis.
Thus, we next explored the second known function of Purple as a catalyst for an intermediate step in the synthesis of the enzymatic co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).
In this pathway, Punch or GTP cyclohydrolase converts GTP to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H<sub>2</sub>-NTP).
Purple (PTPS) then converts H<sub>2</sub>-NTP to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PTP), and Sepiapterin reductase (Sptr) converts the PTP to BH4 (Fig. 3A) \cite{Werner_2011}.
Since Kwak et al. showed oral BH4 can rescue the behavioral phenotypes associated with loss-of-function Sepiapterin reductase mutations in mice \cite{Kwak_2013}, we converted the doses of BH4 effective in mice for use in _Drosophila_.
Specifically, we chose two BH4 doses, one low (0.17 mg/ml) and one high (0.34 mg/ml).
By adding BH4 to the 5% sucrose solution used to acclimate flies to the CAFE assay and switching back to pure 5% sucrose solution for the feeding assays, we can rule out any effect the taste of BH4 may have on the results.
We found that this BH4 pre-feeding produces a dose-dependent reduction in total feeding amount in all genotypes tested, but the effect is much stronger in the hypomorphic _pr_ mutants _pr<sup>1</sup>_ and _pr<sup>G3141</sup>_ than in the "wild-type" controls _w<sup>1118</sup>_ and Canton-S (Fig. 3B).
Pre-feeding with the low BH4 dose also fully rescues the increase in feeding caused by fat body-specific knock-down of _pr_ (Fig. 3C).

For further evidence that the regulation of feeding by _pr_ is dependent on its role in the production of BH4, we next asked whether loss-of-function of the other genes involved in BH4 synthesis can replicate the _pr_ loss-of-function phenotype.
Indeed, we found that fat body-specific knock-down of _Punch_ (_Pu_) using two different Pu-IR lines induces hyperphagia (Fig. 3D and S1A).
Like that caused by the knock-down of _pr_, pre-feeding with low dose BH4 rescues the hyperphagia caused by loss of Pu in the fat body (Fig. 3D).
Sepiapterin Reductase (Sptr) catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of BH4.
Thus, we next measured the appetite of the hypomorphic _Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>_ mutant strain.
We found _Sptr_ mutants eat more than _w<sup>1118</sup>_ flies, but pre-feeding with low dose BH4 rescues this increase in appetite (Fig. 3E).
We then reasoned that if Purple acts upstream of Sptr with regard to this feeding phenotype, over-expression of _pr_ in the adult fat body should not rescue the hyperphagia of _Sptr_ mutants.
To confirm this hypothesis, we used the ubiquitous temperature-sensitive GAL80 to limit the over-expression of _pr_ to the adult fat body in both the _w<sup>1118</sup>_ and _Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>_ genetic backgrounds.
At 18ºC, while GAL80 is active and _pr_ is not being over-expressed, we did not observe any difference between the experimental lines and their corresponding heterozygous controls (Fig. 3F, above).
In flies shifted to 30ºC post-eclosion, however, over-expression of _pr_ in the fat body reduces the feeding of _w<sup>1118</sup>_ flies but not _Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>_ flies (Fig. 3F, below).
