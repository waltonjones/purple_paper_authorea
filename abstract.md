Animals must maintain proper balance between energy intake and expenditure. 
While an animal with access to plenty of food can store energy as fat, proper feedback from the fat to the brain should prevent the intake and storage of so much excess energy that it interferes with survival Ã  la obesity. 
Here we describe a novel function for the enzymatic cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in the regulation of feeding in the vinegar fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. 
Through a directed genetic screen, we found that the expression of the enzymes Punch and Purple in the adult fat body are important for the regulation of feeding amount. 
Punch and Purple catalyze the first two steps in the metabolic pathway that produces BH4. 
Sepiapterin Reductase (Sptr), which catalyzes the final step of BH4 synthesis, is required in the brain, not the fat body. 
We were able to localize the requirement for Sptr in the regulation of feeding to a small population of neurons expressing the neuropeptide NPF, the fly homologue of the vertebrate appetite regulator NPY. 
We show that feeding flies BH4, the final product of this metabolic pathway, rescues all the feeding defects caused by loss-of-function of Punch and Purple in the fat body and of Sptr in the NPF neurons. 
In addition, we show that knock-down of Sptr in the NPF neurons reduces their levels of NPF while feeding flies BH4 dramatically increases NPF accumulation without altering NPF gene expression. 
Thus, BH4, and by extension Punch, Purple, and Sptr, are all required for proper regulation of the NPF neurons and feeding behavior.
