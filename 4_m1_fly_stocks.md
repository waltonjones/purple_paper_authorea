## Methods

### Fly stocks

Flies were maintained in either 18ºC or 25ºC at 60% humidity under a 12h:12h light:dark cycle on standard cornmeal-yeast-corn syrup medium (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/Fly_Work/media-recipes/bloomfood.htm). The only modification in our recipe is the addition of XXX_ of the Tegosept anti-fungal agent. The UAS-miRNA stock library was generated in our lab as previously described (Suh, 2015). To generate UAS-Pu, UAS-pr, UAS-Sptr, each ORF sequence amplified via PCR and inserted into pUASTattB vector. The resulting constructs were microinjected for site-specific insertion on chromosome 2L or 3L using standard method. AstA-Gal4 flies were kindly gifted fron YJ Kim (GIST, South Korea). The following flies used in this study were previously described: S1106-Gal4 \cite{Roman_2001}, FB-Gal4 \cite{Gr_nke_2003}, TH-Gal4 \cite{Friggi_Grelin_2003}, Trh-Gal4 \cite{Alekseyenko_2010}, TPH-Gal4 \cite{Liu_2012}, c673a-Gal4 \cite{Al_Anzi_2009}, Dilp2-Gal4 \cite{Rulifson_2002}, sNPF-Gal4 \cite{Lee_2009}.

The following flies were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center: Canton-S(1), w1118(5905), pr1(370), prG3141(27097), r4-Gal4(33832), tubp-Gal80ts (7018, 7019), PBac{WH}Sptrf04272(18753), Elav-Gal4(8760), 386Y-Gal4(25410), GMR-Gal4(1104), NPF-Gal4(25681), Act5C-Ga4(4414), OK72-Gal4(6486), NPFRMI08636(52133), NPFRc01896(10747), UAS-NaChBac(9466), UAS-Pu-IR1(41998) UAS-pr-IR2(53346), UAS-Sptr-IR1(28968), UAS-Sptr-IR2(43277), UAS-Dhfr-IR(35015), UAS-NPF-IR(27237), UAS-Nos-IR2(28792), UAS-Trh-IR2(25842), UAS-ple-IR2(25796), UAS-Hn-IR2(29540).

The following flies were obtained from VDRC stock center: UAS-Pu-IR2(v107296), UAS-pr-IR1(v109430), UAS-Sptr-IR3(v17018), UAS-Nos-IR1(v108433), UAS-Trh-IR1(v105414), UAS-ple-IR1(v108879), UAS-Hn-IR1(v110511).
