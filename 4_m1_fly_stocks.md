## Methods

### Fly stocks

Flies were maintained at either 18ºC or 25ºC and 60% humidity under a 12h:12h light:dark cycle on standard cornmeal-yeast-corn syrup medium (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/Fly_Work/media-recipes/bloomfood.htm). The only modification in our recipe is the addition of XXX of the Tegosept anti-fungal agent.

The UAS-miRNA stock library was generated in our lab as previously described \cite{Suh_2015}. To generate *UAS-Pu*, *UAS-pr*, *UAS-Sptr*, an ORF sequence amplified via PCR and inserted into pUASTattB vector. The resulting constructs were microinjected for site-specific insertion on chromosome 2L or 3L using standard method.

The AstA-GAL4 flies were a generous gift from Young-Joon Kim (GIST, South Korea). The following flies used in this study were previously described: S<sub>1</sub>106-GAL4 \cite{Roman_2001}, FB-GAL4 \cite{Gr_nke_2003}, TH-GAL4 \cite{Friggi_Grelin_2003}, Trh-GAL4 \cite{Alekseyenko_2010}, TPH-GAL4 \cite{Liu_2012}, c673a-GAL4 \cite{Al_Anzi_2009}, Dilp2-GAL4 \cite{Rulifson_2002}, sNPF-GAL4 \cite{Lee_2009}.

The following fly stocks (stock number) were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center: Canton-S (1), w<sup>1118</sup> (5905), pr<sup>1</sup> (370), pr<sup>G3141</sup> (27097), r4-GAL4 (33832), tubP-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> (7018, 7019), PBac{WH}Sptr<sup>f04272</sup> (18753), elav-GAL4 (8760), 386Y-GAL4 (25410), GMR-GAL4 (1104), NPF-GAL4 (25681), Act5C-GAL4 (4414), OK72-GAL4 (6486), NPFR<sup>MI08636</sup> (52133), NPFR<sup>c01896</sup> (10747), UAS-NaChBac (9466), UAS-Pu-IR1 (41998), UAS-pr-IR2 (53346), UAS-Sptr-IR1 (28968), UAS-Sptr-IR2 (43277), UAS-NPF-IR1 (27237), UAS-Nos-IR2 (28792), UAS-Trh-IR2 (25842), UAS-ple-IR2 (25796), UAS-Hn-IR2 (29540).

The following fly stocks (stock number) were obtained from the VDRC Stock Center: UAS-Pu-IR2 (v107296), UAS-pr-IR1 (v109430), UAS-Sptr-IR3 (v17018), UAS-Nos-IR1 (v108433), UAS-Trh-IR1 (v105414), UAS-ple-IR1 (v108879), UAS-Hn-IR1 (v110511).
