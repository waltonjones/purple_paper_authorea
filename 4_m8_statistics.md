### Statistics

All boxplots in this study follow the standard Tukey style. We performed ANOVA analyses followed by pairwise t-tests, correcting for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method, to determine statistical significance. Statistically significant results are designated with asterisks (*** _P_ ≤ 0.001, ** _P_ ≤ 0.01, * _P_ ≤ 0.05). All statistical analysis and figure generation was performed in R \cite{{R Core Team 2015}}.
