### Quantitative RT--PCR

RNA was extracted from whole bodies of 20 adult flies. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Real Time PCR was performed using the Bio-Rad CFX96TM Real Time System (Bio-Rad, USA). Rp49 was used as standards. Primers (5' to 3') used were as follows: 
NPF-F: GATGCCTACAAGTTCCTGCAGG; NPF-R: GTGACGTTGCCATGGTCGT; Rp49-F: ATGACCATCCGCCCAGCATA; Rp49-R: GAGAACGCAGGCGACCGTTG.
