## Quantitative RT-PCR

After extracting total RNA from the heads of 20 adult flies per sample using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA), we synthesized cDNAs using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA). We then performed qPCR amplification using the TOPrealTM qPCR 2X PreMIX (Enzynomics, KOREA) with a CFX96TM Real Time System (Bio-Rad, USA). We used Rp49 for normalization and quantified NPF expression using Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 software. The primers (5' to 3') were as follows: NPF (GATGCCTACAAGTTCCTGCAGG and GTGACGTTGCCATGGTCGT); Rp49 (ATGACCATCCGCCCAGCATA and GAGAACGCAGGCGACCGTTG).
