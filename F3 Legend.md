Figure 3 Sptr expression in NPF neuron, not in fat body, is required to regulate appetite behavior

**a,** Sptr knockdown in fat body does not show increased feeding phenotype (n = 20-29). ** b,** Pan-neuronal Sptr knockdown shows increased feeding (n = 27-28). **c,** Hemolymph specific expression of Pu and pr decreased feeding (n = 30). **d,** NPF specific Sptr knockdown shows increased feeding and it can be rescued by BH4 pre-feeding (n = 30). **e,** Adult specific Sptr knockdown in NPF neurons shows increased feeding (n=30). **f,** pr knockdown in NPF shows normal feeding (n=27-34). **g,** NPF specific Sptr expression rescues hyperphagia of Sptr mutant flies (n = 30).
