To identify novel genes in appetite regulation from fat body, we used two-step screening method (Fig. 1A). For primary screening, we performed miRNA-based overexpression screen using fat body specific gene-switch driver S<sub>1</sub>106-Gal4 crossed to a library of 131 UAS-miRNA lines that generated in our lab \cite{Suh_2015}. For the measurement of changes in appetite behavior, we used modified capillary feeder (CAFE) assay \cite{Ja_2007} with 24hr habituation followed by 32hr measurement (Fig. 1B). From miRNA screening, we found that overexpression of _miR-iab-4_ in fat body increases _ad lib_ feeding. Two different fat body specific drivers, S<sub>1</sub>106-Gal4 (Fig. 1C, D)\cite{Roman_2001} and r4-Gal4 (Fig. 1E) \cite{Lee_2004}, both showed increased feeding, which confirm the importance of _miR-iab-4_ in fat body for appetite regulation.

To identify targets of _miR-iab-4_ in appetite regulation, we searched putative target genes of _miR-iab-4_ predicted by Targetscan (www.targetscan.org) and miRanda (www.microRNA.org). Among these, we performed secondary RNAi screening for 21 target genes that are highly expressed in fat body. From the secondary screening using RNAi lines, we identified gene _purple_ (_pr_) as new regulator of appetite behavior. We used two different pr-RNAi lines (UAS-pr-IR1 from Vienna Stock Center; UAS-pr-IR2 from Bloomington Stock Center) and both significantly enhanced _ad lib_ feeding (Fig. 2A, B). We also tested another fat body specific Gal4 line FB-Gal4 \cite{Gr_nke_2003}, which showed similar phenotype (Fig. 2C). It is known that _pr_ is highly expressed in fly eyes \cite{Kim_2013}. When we knockdown _pr_ specifically in eyes, however, animals showed normal feeding behavior (Fig. 2D). It suggests that _pr_ expression in eyes is not involved in feeding behavior. When we knockdown _pr_ in fat body only in adult stage, the animals still showed hyperphagic phenotype (Fig. 2E) suggesting that _pr_ expression in adult fat body is still important for the appetite regulation. 

To confirm the function of Purple in appetitie behavior, we also tested two _pr_ mutant lines and found they showed increased feeding phenotype (Fig. 2F). Since _pr_ mutants showed hyperphagia, we asked whether the expression of _pr_ on fat body is enough to rescue the phenotype. Without _pr_ mutation, the over-expression of _pr_ in fat body caused anorexic phenotype (Fig. 2G top). When we express _pr_ in fat body under the _pr_ mutant background, flies showed significantly decreased feeding compare to other _pr_ mutant controls (Fig. 2G bottom). These data suggests that _pr_ expression on fat body is critical for appetite regulation.
