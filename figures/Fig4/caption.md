**Sptr expression in NPF neuron, not in fat body, is required to regulate appetite behavior**

(A) Sptr knockdown in fat body does not show increased feeding phenotype (n = 20-29). (B) Pan-neuronal Sptr knockdown shows increased feeding (n = 27-28). (C) NPF specific Sptr knockdown shows increased feeding and it can be rescued by BH4 pre-feeding (n = 30). (D) Adult specific Sptr knockdown in NPF neurons shows increased feeding (n = 30). (E) pr knockdown in NPF shows normal feeding (n = 27-34). (F) NPF specific Sptr expression rescues hyperphagia of Sptr mutant flies (n = 30).
