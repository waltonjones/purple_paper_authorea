**Fig S4 NPF specific knockdown of BH4-related genes show normal feeding**

(A) NPF specific Sptr knockdown (second RNAi line) shows increased feeding and it can be rescued by BH4 pre-feeding (n = 24-30). (B) NPF specific Sptr knockdown (third RNAi line) shows increased feeding (n = 26-27). (C) Pu knockdown in NPF neuron shows normal feeding (n=20). (D) NPF specific Sptr over-expression decreases feeding (n = 40).
