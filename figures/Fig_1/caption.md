**Fat body specific miR-overexpression screening reveals novel function of gene purple in feeding behavior**

**a,** Flowchart explaining screening process. **b,** Schematic diagram of modified CAFE assay. **c,** Summary of miRNA overexpression screening. Gray dots represent each UAS-miR lines tested.See Suh 2015 for the line information. **d,** Increased feeding from fat body specific miR-iab-4 overexpression using r4-Gal4 (n=27- 37). Gray dots represent each CAFE data. **e,** Increased feeding by fat body specific purple knockdown in entire stage (n=25-38). **f,** Adult specific pr knockdown in fat body: In permissive temperature (18oC), flies didn't show difference among groups. However, flies transferred to 30oC after eclosion showed increased feeding only in test group compare to controls (n = 28-30). **g,** Increased feeding in pr mutant flies (n = 25--32). **h,** Decreased feeding by overexpression of pr in fat body (n = 25). **i,** hyperphagic phenotype of pr mutant can be rescued by the expression of pr in fat body (n = 25)
