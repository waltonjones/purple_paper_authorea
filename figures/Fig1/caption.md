**Figure 1. A fat body-specific genetic screen reveals a role for *purple* in feeding behavior**

(A) Flowchart explaining our two-tiered miRNA-based screen for fat body modulators of feeding. (B) Schematic of the modified CAFE assay. (C) Summary of the primary miRNA over-expression screen. Each dot represents the feeding of the S<sub>1</sub>106-GAL4 line driving the expression of one UAS-miRNA line in the fat body. The feeding fold change versus the heterozygous *S<sub>1</sub>106-GAL4/+* control is plotted against the *P*-value as determined by a Student's t-test. Significance thresholds, both uncorrected and corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni method), are indicated. (D) and (E): Increased feeding from fat body specific miR-iab-4 overexpression using geneswitch driver S1106-Gal4 (D, n = 11-20) and r4-Gal4 (E, n=27- 37). (F) Increased feeding by fat body specific pr knockdown in entire stage (n=25-38). (G) Adult specific pr knockdown in fat body: In permissive temperature (18oC), flies didnâ€™t show difference among groups. However, flies transferred to 30oC after eclosion showed increased feeding only in test group compare to controls (n=28-30). (H) Increased feeding in pr mutant flies (n = 25-32). (I) Hyperphagic phenotype of pr mutant can be rescued by overexpression of pr in fat body (n = 25)
