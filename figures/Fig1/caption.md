**Fat body specific miR-overexpression screening reveals novel function of gene purple in feeding behavior**

(A) Flowchart explaining screening process. (B) Schematic diagram of modified CAFE assay. (C) Summary of miRNA overexpression screening. Gray dots represent each UAS-miR lines tested. (D) and (E): Increased feeding from fat body specific miR-iab-4 overexpression using geneswitch driver S1106-Gal4 (D, n = 11-20) and r4-Gal4 (E, n=27- 37). (F) Increased feeding by fat body specific pr knockdown in entire stage (n=25-38). (G) Adult specific pr knockdown in fat body: In permissive temperature (18oC), flies didnâ€™t show difference among groups. However, flies transferred to 30oC after eclosion showed increased feeding only in test group compare to controls (n=28-30). (H) Increased feeding in pr mutant flies (n = 25-32). (I) Hyperphagic phenotype of pr mutant can be rescued by overexpression of pr in fat body (n = 25)
