**Figure 1. Primary genetic screen shows miR-iab-4 over-expression in the adult fat body increases feeding**

(A) Flowchart explaining our two-tiered miRNA-based screen for fat body modulators of feeding.
(B) Schematic of the modified CAFE assay.
(C) Summary of the primary miRNA over-expression screen. Each dot represents the feeding of the S<sub>1</sub>106-GAL4 line driving the expression of one UAS-miRNA line in the fat body. The feeding fold change versus the heterozygous *S<sub>1</sub>106-GAL4/+* control is plotted against the *P*-value as determined by a Student's t-test. Significance thresholds, both uncorrected and corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni method), are indicated.
(D and E): Fat body-specific over-expression of miR-iab-4 using both the (D) RU486-inducible S<sub>1</sub>106-GAL4 (n=11–20) and (E) the constitutive r4-GAL4 (n=27–37) increases feeding.
(F) Constitutive fat body-specific knock-down of *pr* with r4-GAL4 (*r4>pr-IR1*) increases feeding (n=25–38). 
(G) Adult fat body-specific knock-down of *pr* by combining r4-GAL4 with the temperature-sensitive tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> increases feeding. Although there is no difference between genotypes at the permissive temperature (18ºC), *GAL80<sup>ts</sup>,r4>pr-IR1* flies transferred to 30ºC post-eclosion eat more than heterozygous controls (n=28–30).
(H) Two hypomorphic pr mutants, *pr<sup>1</sup>* and *pr<sup>G3141</sup>*, eat more than Canton S and w<sup>1118</sup> controls (n=25–32).
(I) Over-expression of pr in the fat body reduces feeding in the w<sup>1118</sup> genetic background (above) and rescues the hyperphagia of the *pr<sup>G3141</sup>* mutant background (below) (n=25).
