**Figure 6. Changes of food condition affect feeding amount and expression levels of BH4-related genes in fat body.**
 (A) Feeding amount changes in wild type Canton-S flies after high energy food (30% coconut oil-mixed food, 4 days) feeding (n=30) or
low energy food (1% sucrose solution, 4 days) feeding (n=35)
(B) Punch gene expression under the same conditions as (A) as measured by qPCR. Each bar represents the mean Â± s.e.m. of 3 technical replicates of each of 3 biological samples (high energy food) or 4 biological samples (low energy food) consisting of RNA extracted from 15 adult flies.
(C) Purple gene expression under the same conditions as (A) as measured by qPCR.
(D) A model for the function of BH4 in the regulation of appetite.
