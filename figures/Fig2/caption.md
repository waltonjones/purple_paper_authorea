**Figure 2. Purple expression in the fat body is critical for the regulation of feeding amount.**

(A) Constitutive fat body-specific knock-down of *pr* using r4-GAL4 (*r4>pr-IR1*) increases feeding (n=25--38) when compared to heterozygous controls.
(B) Fat body-specific knock-down of *pr* with a second RNAi line (UAS-pr-IR2) specific to a different part of *pr* also increases feeding (n=25--26).
(C) Knock-down of *pr* using a different fat body-specific GAL4 line (FB-Gal4) increases feeding (n=20).
(D) Eye-specific *pr* knock-down with GMR-GAL4 does not alter feeding (n=23).
(E) Adult fat body-specific knock-down of *pr* by combining r4-GAL4 with the temperature-sensitive tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> increases feeding. Although there is no difference between genotypes at the permissive temperature (18ºC), *GAL80<sup>ts</sup>,r4>pr-IR1* flies transferred to 30ºC post-eclosion eat more than heterozygous controls (n=28--30).
(F) Two hypomorphic *pr* mutants, *pr<sup>1</sup>* and *pr<sup>G3141</sup>*, eat more than Canton S and w<sup>1118</sup> controls (n=25--32).
(G) Over-expression of *pr* in the fat body reduces feeding in the *w<sup>1118</sup>* genetic background (above) and rescues the hyperphagia of the *pr<sup>G3141</sup>* mutant background (below) (n=25).
