**Figure 2. Purple expression in the fat body is critical for the regulation of feeding amount.**

(A) Constitutive fat body-specific knock-down of *pr* with r4-GAL4 (*r4>pr-IR1*) increases feeding (n=25–38) when compared to heterozygous controls.
(B) Fat body-specific knockdown of *pr* with a second RNAi line (*UAS-pr-IR2*) specific to a different part of *pr* also increases feeding (n=25-26).
(C) Fat body-specific Purple knockdown using FB-Gal4 (n=20). (C) Eye specific pr knockdown does not show changes in feeding amount (n = 23)
(E) Adult fat body-specific knock-down of *pr* by combining r4-GAL4 with the temperature-sensitive tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> increases feeding. Although there is no difference between genotypes at the permissive temperature (18ºC), *GAL80<sup>ts</sup>,r4>pr-IR1* flies transferred to 30ºC post-eclosion eat more than heterozygous controls (n=28–30).
(H) Two hypomorphic pr mutants, *pr<sup>1</sup>* and *pr<sup>G3141</sup>*, eat more than Canton S and w<sup>1118</sup> controls (n=25--32).
(I) Over-expression of pr in the fat body reduces feeding in the w<sup>1118</sup> genetic background (above) and rescues the hyperphagia of the *pr<sup>G3141</sup>* mutant background (below) (n=25).
