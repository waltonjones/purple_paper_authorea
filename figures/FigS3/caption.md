**Figure S3, related to Figure 4. Manipulation of BH4-related genes in NPF neurons.**

(A) NPF neuron-specific knock-down of *Sptr* using a second RNAi line (UAS-Sptr-IR2) induces a hyperphagic phenotype that can be rescued rescued by pre-feeding the flies with 0.17 mg/ml BH4(n=24–30).
(B) NPF neuron-specific knock-down of *Sptr* with a third RNAi line (UAS-Sptr-IR3) increases feeding (n=26–27).
(C) NPF neuron-specific knock-down of *Pu* does not affect feeding (n=20).
(D) NPF neuron-specific over-expression of *Sptr* reduces feeding (n=40).
