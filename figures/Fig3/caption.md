**Figure 3. Gene pr involves in appetite behavior through BH4 biosynthesis pathway**

(A) Graphical summary of the BH4 biosynthesis pathway. GTP: Guanosine triphosphate; H<sub>2</sub>-NTP: 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate; PTP: 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin; BH4: 6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin).
(B) Rescue of hyperphagia in pr mutants by BH4 pre-feeding (n=20--40).
(C) and (D): Fat body specific pr or Pu knockdown cause increased feeding, which can be rescued by BH4 (C, n=20--26; D, n=20--25).
(E) Sptr mutant flies show increased feeding compare to controls, which is rescuable by BH4 pre-feeding (n=20--26).
(F) Decreased feeding by fat body specific pr overexpression disappears under Sptr mutant background (n = 27).
