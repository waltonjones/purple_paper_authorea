**Figure 3. Purple regulates feeding through its role in BH4 biosynthesis.**

(A) Graphical summary of the BH4 biosynthesis pathway. GTP: Guanosine triphosphate; H<sub>2</sub>-NTP: 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate; PTP: 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin; BH4: 6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin).
(B) Feeding both wild-type and *pr* mutants BH4 causes a dose-dependent reduction in feeding (n=20--40). The linear regression lines (black) and 95% confidence intervals (gray) are shown. Note the steeper decline in the hyperphagic *pr* mutants.
(C and D) Pre-feeding with 0.17 mg/ml BH4 rescues the increase in feeding caused by fat body-specific knockdown of (C) *pr* (n=20--26) and (D) *Pu* (n=20--25).
(E) Hypomorphic *Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>* mutant flies eat more than *w<sup>1118</sup>* controls, and their hyperphagia is rescued by pre-feeding with 0.17 mg/ml BH4 (n=20--26).
(F) While no effect appears at the permissive temperature (18ºC), at the restrictive temperature (30ºC) adult fat body-specific over-expression of *pr* (gray boxplots) reduces feeding below the level of heterozygous controls (white boxplots) in the *w<sup>1118</sup>* background but not the *Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>* mutant background (n=27).
