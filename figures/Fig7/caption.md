**Figure 7. A model for the function of BH4 in the regulation of appetite.**

Punch and Purple are required in the fat body to generate PTP from GTP. PTP is then transferred to the brain where it is converted to BH4 in the NPF neurons. Through an as yet unknown mechanism, BH4 reduces NPF release, which in turn reduces feeding. Solid arrow indicate single step enzymatic conversions and dotted lines indicate what are likely multi-step processes.
