**Figure S5, related to Figure 6. Knock-down of BH4-related genes cause resistance in starvation.**
(A) Fat body specific knock-down of gene Punch (r4-G4 > Pu-IR1) shows more resistant in starvation compare to control groups (n=60)
(B) Fat body specific knock-down of gene purple (r4-G4> pr-IR1) shows more resistant in starvation (n=50)
(C) Sptr knock-down in NPF expressing neurons (NPF-G4>Sptr-IR1) also shows longer survival in starvation (n=50)
