**Figure 5. BH4 acts via NPF-NPFR signalling to modulate appetite.**

(A) NPF knockdown in NPF expressing neuron shows decreased ad lib feeding (n=30).
(B) NPF receptor mutants show decreased feeding phenotypes (n=30).
(C) Sptr knockdown in NPF neurons under the npfr mutant background shows decreased feeding (n=35).
(D) NPF antibody staining on brains of NPF specific Sptr knockdown flies with or without BH4 feeding. Arrowheads indicate NPF cell bodies.
(E) Comparison between intensities of NPF stained cell bodies. 12 NPF cell bodies (3 brains) from each group used for intensity comparison.
(F) Comparison of NPF gene expression level among same flies as (D) and (E). Three biological samples used for quantitative PCR reaction.
(G) Constitutive activation of NPF neurons causes hyperphagia, which is not rescuable by BH4 pre-feeding (n=30).
