Fig 5 BH4 regulates appetite behavior by inhibiting NPF release

(A) NPF knockdown in NPF expressing neuron shows decreased ad lib feeding (n = 30). (B) NPF receptor mutants show decreased feeding phenotypes (n = 30). (D) NPF antibody staining on brains of NPF specific Sptr knockdown flies with or without BH4 feeding. (E) Comparison between intensities of NPF stained cell bodies (Left) and NPF gene expression level (right). 12 NPF cell bodies (3 brains) from each group used for intensity comparison. Three biological samples used for quantitative PCR reaction. (F) Constitutive activation of NPF neurons cause hyperphagia, which is not rescuable by BH4 pre-feeding (n = 30). (G) A model for appetite control by fat body. Pu and pr generate PTP from GTP in fat body. PTP is transferred to brain (NPF neuron) where BH4 is generated. Increaed BH4 inhibits NPF release, which changes appetite behavior.
