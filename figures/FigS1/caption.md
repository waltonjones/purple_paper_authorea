**Figure S1, related to Figure 3 and 4. With regard to its role in feeding, BH4 synthesis is split between the fat body and the brain.**

(A) Fat body-specific knock-down of *Pu* using a second RNAi line (UAS-Pu-IR2) increases feeding (n=25).
(B) Knock-down of *Sptr* using a second fat body GAL4 line (FB-Gal4) does not affect feeding (n=22--23).
(C) Pan-neuronal knock-down of *Sptr* using a second RNAi line (UAS-Sptr-IR3) increases feeding (n=23).
(D) Pan-neuronal knock-down of *pr* does not affect feeding (n=25--26).
