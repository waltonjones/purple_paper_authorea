### Feeding assays

To assess ad libitum adult fly feeding, we used a modiﬁed capillary feeder (CAFE) assay \cite{Ja_2007} with modification as followed: we transfer two 5-day old male ﬂies to a standard ﬂy vial containing only a wet Kimwipe. We then introduce a calibrated 20 µl capillary ﬁlled with 5% sucrose solution as the only food source. We allow the ﬂies to acclimate for 24 hours before starting the experiment. The next day, we reﬁll the capillary and allow the flies to feed over the course of 32 hours before measuring the total consumption at 19:00 the following day.

For RU486 feeding, we starved 4-day old males for 24hr with water only followed by RU486 (mifepristone;Sigma) mixed 5% sucrose solution for 24 hr. Final RU486 concentration was 0.01 M. After RU486 feeding, 32 hr CAFE test was followed.

For BH4 feeding, we used BH4-mixed 5% sucrose solution (BH4; Product number: 11.212-5. Schircks Laboratories, Switzerland) during 24hr acclimation and changed the capillary with a new capillary with normal 5% sucrose solution for the CAFE test. BH4-mixed 5% sucrose solution was made freshly for every experiment. For immunostaining and qPCR of BH4 fed flies, we fed 5-day old flies with 0.34mg BH4-sucrose solution for 2 days. Freshly made BH4-sucrose solution used for each day.
