## Feeding assays

To assess *ad libitum* feeding in adult flies, we modified the capillary feeder (CAFE) assay described by Ja et al. \cite{Ja_2007}. We transferred two 5-day old male flies to a standard fly vial containing only a wet Kimwipe. We then introduced a calibrated 20 Âµl capillary filled with 5% sucrose in water between the sponge plug and the side of the vial. We allowed the flies to acclimate for 24 hours before refilling the capillary. Finally, we allowed the flies to feed for 32 hours before measuring total consumption. We controlled for evaporation using identical vials without flies.

For the experiments using the S<sub>1</sub>106-GAL4 line, we transferred 4-day old males to the vial containing the wet Kimwipe and starved them for 24 hr. We then introduced a capillary containing 0.01 M RU486 (Sigma-Aldrich, South Korea) and 5% sucrose in water for 24 hr. The subsequent CAFE assays were identical to those described above.

For experiments involving BH4 treatment, we included either 0.17 or 0.34 mg/ml BH4 (Schircks Laboratories (11.212-5), Switzerland) in the 5% sucrose solution provided during the 24 hr acclimation stage. Then, we replaced the capillary with one containing only 5% sucrose for the feeding measurement. For the immunostaining and qPCR experiments, we fed 5-day old flies for 2 days from capillaries containing 0.34 mg/X BH4 in 5% sucrose. To avoid contamination and any chance that it would lose its effectiveness, we prepared fresh BH4-sucrose solutions every day.
