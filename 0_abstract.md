# Summary

Eating food is critical procedure to get energy and nutrition to all animals. Feeding amount should be tightly regulated, however, to maintain proper balance between energy intake and expenditure avoiding adverse effect such as obesity \cite{Trivedi_2014, Simpson_2015}. When the animal eats too much food, extra energy is saved as fat in adipose tissue. The feedback pathway for appetite regulation from adipose tissue, energy storage center, to brain, feeding control center, is largely unknown. Here we discovered a novel function of a cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in appetite regulation in fruit fly, Drosophila, through fat body, a functional homolog of vertebrate adipose tissue, and brain. From fat body specific screening, we found the expression of BH4-related genes Punch and purple in fat body is critical to regulate feeding amount. Interestingly, Sptr, the gene involved in the final step of BH4 synthesis, should be expressed in brain, not fat body. In brain, we found Sptr expression in NPF, homolog of vertebrate NPY, expressing neuron is important for appetite control. In NPF neurons, BH4 feeding increased NPF accumulation in cell body without changes in NPF gene expression, meaning the inhibition of NPF release. On the other hand, Sptr knockdown in NPF neurons decreased it. This provides a potentially general function of BH4 in appetite regulation through inhibition of neuropeptide hormone release.
