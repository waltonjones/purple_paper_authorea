Next, we investigated Sptr knockdown on fat body to verify its effect on appetite behavior. To our surprise, we did not observe any increases in feeding from three different Sptr-IR lines (Fig. 3a). We also observed normal feeding behavior from Sptr knockdown using other fat body driver FB-Gal4(Extended Data Fig. 3a). We tested Sptr knockdown on eyes (GMR-Gal4), which does not show any phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 3B). We also tested Dhfr knockdown, which is known to involve in salvage pathway of BH4 biosynthesis (Extended Data Fig. 3c), but it was normal (Extended Data Fig. 3d). We observed hyperphagia using whole-body driver Act5C-Gal4 (Extended Data Fig. 4a) meaning that knockdown itself is effective. So, we tried pan-neuronal driver elav-Gal4 because appetite behavior is controlled by neurons after all. Surprisingly, Sptr knockdown in whole neuron showed increased feeding (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 3e). Peptidergic neuronal driver 386Y-Gal4 also showed increased feeding (Extened Data Fig. 3f). Since pr knockdown on brain does not show increased feeding (Extended Data Fig. 3G), we concluded that pr expression and Sptr expression are supposed to happen in two different places as in fat body and in brain for the regulation of appetite behavior. This means intermediate metabolite PTP suppose to be transfered from fat to brain, possibly through hemolymph. To confirm PTP transferring through hemolymph, we ectopically express Pu and pr in hemolymph using hemolymph driver Hml-Gal4. When Pu and pr is expressed in hemocytes, flies eat less phenocopying pr over-expression on fat body (Fig. 3c).

After we found that brain is the place where Sptr is critical for appetite regulation, we tested diverse feeding-related locations to pinpoint the target neurons (Extended Data Fig. 4). Among these, we found that Sptr knockdown on NPF expressing neurons shows increased feeding. We tested three UAS-Sptr-RNAi lines and all of them showed hyperphagia (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). BH4 feeding, similar as the result from fat body, rescued hyperphagia of NPF-Gal4>UAS-Sptr-IR flies (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5a).


NPF specific Sptr knockdown flies showed longer survival in starvation, suggesting they accumulated more fat because they ate more. We tested knockdown of Dhfr, which is known to be involved in salvage pathway. But result wasnâ€™t clear (Figure S5D), probably because it is not necessary for the BH4 synthesis. 


Knockdown of pr or pu in NPF neurons did not cause any changes in feeding amount (Figure 4C and S5E), supporting that pu and pr are expressed not in NPF but in fat body to control ad lib feeding behavior. 

To further confirm the location of Sptr expression, we expressed Sptr gene in NPF neurons under the Sptr mutant background.  In non-permissive temperature (18oC), all flies having Sptr mutant background ate more than control (Figure S5F). However, when we increase temperature (30oC) and let NPF-Gal4 express Sptr in NPF neurons, hyperphagia was rescued and flies ate much less than controls even though they are under Sptr mutant background (Figure 4D).
