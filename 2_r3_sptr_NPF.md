Next, we investigated Sptr knockdown on fat body to verify its effect on appetite behavior. To our surprise, we did not observe any increases in feeding from three different Sptr-IR lines (Fig. 3a). We also observed normal feeding behavior from Sptr knockdown using other fat body driver FB-Gal4(Extended Data Fig. 3a). We tested Sptr knockdown on eyes (GMR-Gal4), which does not show any phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 3B). We also tested Dhfr knockdown, which is known to involve in salvage pathway of BH4 biosynthesis (Extended Data Fig. 3c), but it was normal (Extended Data Fig. 3d). We observed hyperphagia using whole-body driver Act5C-Gal4 (Extended Data Fig. 4a) meaning that knockdown itself is effective. So, we tried pan-neuronal driver elav-Gal4 because appetite behavior is controlled by neurons after all. Surprisingly, Sptr knockdown in whole neuron showed increased feeding (Figure 3D and S3E). Peptidergic neuronal driver 386Y-Gal4 also showed increased feeding (Figure 3E). Since pr knockdown on brain does not show increased feeding (Figure 3F), we concluded that pr expression and Sptr expression are supposed to happen in two different places as in fat body and in brain for the regulation of appetite behavior.

We tested involvement of of eye on the process, but Sptr knockdown on eyes did not show the phenotype (Figure S3F)

To identify Sptr expressing neurons for appetite regulation, we performed another set of CAFE screening using UAS-Sptr-IR lines and known feeding-related Gal4 lines (Figure S4)(). To our surprise, we observed similar feeding phenotype when we knockdown Sptr in NPF expressing neurons. We tested three UAS-Sptr-RNAi lines and all of them showed hyperphagia (Figure 4A, S5A and S5B). BH4 feeding, similar as tested on fat body, rescued hyperphagia of NPF-Gal4>UAS-Sptr-IR flies (Figure 4A and S5A). NPF specific Sptr knockdown flies showed longer survival in starvation, suggesting they accumulated more fat because they ate more. We tested knockdown of Dhfr, which is known to be involved in salvage pathway. But result wasnâ€™t clear (Figure S5D), probably because it is not necessary for the BH4 synthesis. Knockdown of pr or pu in NPF neurons did not cause any changes in feeding amount (Figure 4C and S5E), supporting that pu and pr are expressed not in NPF but in fat body to control ad lib feeding behavior. To further confirm the location of Sptr expression, we expressed Sptr gene in NPF neurons under the Sptr mutant background.  In non-permissive temperature (18oC), all flies having Sptr mutant background ate more than control (Figure S5F). However, when we increase temperature (30oC) and let NPF-Gal4 express Sptr in NPF neurons, hyperphagia was rescued and flies ate much less than controls even though they are under Sptr mutant background (Figure 4D).
