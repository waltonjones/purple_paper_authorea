Extended Data Figure 5 Sptr expression in NPF neuron is critical for appetite control 

A, NPF specific Sptr knockdown (second RNAi line) shows increased feeding and it can be rescued by BH4 pre-feeding (n = 24-30). B, NPF specific Sptr knockdown (third RNAi line) shows increased feeding (n = 26-27). C, Pu knockdown in NPF neuron shows normal feeding (n=20). D, NPF specific Sptr knockdown shows more resistant upon starvation (n = 60). E, NPF specific Sptr over-expression decreases feeding (n = 40). F, Dhfr knockdown in NPF neuron shows normal feeding (n = 16-20).
