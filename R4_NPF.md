4. BH4 function in feeding requires NPF neurons 

To identify Sptr expressing neurons for appetite regulation, we performed another set of CAFE screening using UAS-Sptr-IR lines and known feeding-related Gal4 lines (Figure S4)(). To our surprise, we observed similar feeding phenotype when we knockdown Sptr in NPF expressing neurons. We tested three UAS-Sptr-RNAi lines and all of them showed hyperphagia (Figure 4A, S5A and S5B). BH4 feeding, similar as tested on fat body, rescued hyperphagia of NPF-Gal4>UAS-Sptr-IR flies (Figure 4A and S5A). NPF specific Sptr knockdown flies showed longer survival in starvation, suggesting they accumulated more fat because they ate more. We tested knockdown of Dhfr, which is known to be involved in salvage pathway. But result wasnâ€™t clear (Figure S5D), probably because it is not necessary for the BH4 synthesis. Knockdown of pr or pu in NPF neurons did not cause any changes in feeding amount (Figure 4C and S5E), supporting that pu and pr are expressed not in NPF but in fat body to control ad lib feeding behavior. To further confirm the location of Sptr expression, we expressed Sptr gene in NPF neurons under the Sptr mutant background.  In non-permissive temperature (18oC), all flies having Sptr mutant background ate more than control (Figure S5F). However, when we increase temperature (30oC) and let NPF-Gal4 express Sptr in NPF neurons, hyperphagia was rescued and flies ate much less than controls even though they are under Sptr mutant background (Figure 4D).
