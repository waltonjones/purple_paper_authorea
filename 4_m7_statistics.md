## Statistics
All boxplots in this study follow the standard Tukey style.
We determined statistical significance by performing ANOVA analyses followed by pairwise t-tests, correcting for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method.
We designated all statistically significant results with asterisks (*** _P_ ≤ 0.001, ** _P_ ≤ 0.01, * _P_ ≤ 0.05).
In all figures, the _P_ values of relevant statistical comparisons labeled with "n.s." fell below these thresholds and were therefore non-significant.
We used the R programming language for all statistical analysis and figure generation \cite{R}.
