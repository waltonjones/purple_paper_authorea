To identify regulators of appetite expressed in the fat body, we designed a two-tiered genetic screen similar to that described by Bhat and Jones (ADD CITATION HERE). In the primary screen, we identify a miRNA or miRNAs whose tissue-specific over-expression in the fat body alters adult feeding. After limiting a list of predicted miRNA targets to those expressed in the fat body, we  perform a small secondary RNAi screen for gene or genes responsible for the feeding phenotype (Fig. 1A). In the primary screen, we crossed a subset of a library of UAS-miRNAs \cite{Suh_2015} to the RU486-inducible fat body-specific GAL4 driver S<sub>1</sub>106-GAL4 generated by Roman et al. \cite{Roman_2001}. We used a modified form of the capillary feeder (CAFE) assay originally described by Ja et al. \cite{Ja_2007} to measure total adult feeding for 32 hours (Fig. 1B). In this primary screen, we found some miRNAs that reduced feeding and others that enhanced feeding by up to ~35%, but none with a *P*-value that met the Bonferroni corrected threshold for statistical significance (Fig. 1C and Table S1). Of these results, we decided to follow-up on the adult fat body-specific over-expression of *miR-iab-4*, which increased adult *ad libitum* feeding by ~27% (Fig. 1D). Over-expression of *miR-iab-4* using the constitutive fat body-specific driver r4-GAL4 \cite{Lee_2004} produced a slightly larger and more significant increase in adult feeding beyond that of the appropriate heterozygous controls (Fig. 1E).
