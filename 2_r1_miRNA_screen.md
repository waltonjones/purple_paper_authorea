Genome-wide miRNA screening in fat body

To identify novel genes in appetite regulation from fat body, we used two-step screening method (Figure 1A). For primary screening, we performed miRNA-based overexpression screen using fat body specific gene-switch driver S1106-Gal4 crossed to a library of 131 UAS-miRNA lines that generated in our lab \cite{Suh_2015}. For the measurement of changes in appetite behavior, we used modified capillary feeder (CAFE) assay \cite{Ja_2007} with 24hr habituation followed by 32hr measurement (Figure 1B). From miRNA screening, we found that overexpression of miR-iab-4 in fat body increases ad lib feeding (Figure 1C and 1D). Two different fat body specific drivers, S1106-Gal4\cite{Roman_2001} and r4-Gal4 \cite{Lee_2004}, both showed increased feeding, which confirm the importance of miR-iab-4 in fat body for appetite regulation (Figure 1D and 1E).

To identify targets of miR-iab-4 in appetite regulation, we searched putative target genes of miR-iab-4 predicted by Targetscan (www.targetscan.org) and miRanda (www.microRNA.org). Among these, we performed secondary RNAi screening for 21 target genes that are highly expressed in fat body (Table S1). From the secondary screening using RNAi lines, we identified gene _purple_ as new regulator of appetite behavior. We used two different pr-RNAi lines (UAS-pr-IR1 from Vienna Stock Center; UAS-pr-IR2 from Bloomington Stock Center) and both significantly enhanced _ad lib_ feeding (Figure 1F and Figure S1A). We also tested another fat body specific Gal4 line FB-Gal4 \cite{Gr_nke_2003}, which showed similar phenotype (Figure S1B). 

[[Remove Figure S1C-GMR>pr-IR1 for now
Gene purple (pr) is named after its purple eye color of purple mutants and it is known that pr is highly expressed in fly eyes. When we knockdown pr specifically in eyes, animals showed normal feeding behavior (Figure S1C). It suggests that pr expression in eyes is not involved in feeding behavior. ]]

When we knockdown _pr_ in fat body only in adult stage, the animals still showed hyperphagic phenotype (Figure 1G) suggesting that _pr_ expression in adult fat body is still critical for the appetite regulation.
