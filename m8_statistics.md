### Statistics

Boxplots in this study follow the standard style. For the multiple comparisons, we performed a one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise t-tests using the Bonferroni method to adjust the P value threshold for significance. Regarding the barplots in Fig. 5E, we present the mean Â± s.e.m. and make comparisons between groups using the Student's t-test considering _P_<0.05 as statistically significant (*** _p_<0.001, ** _p_<0.01, *_p_<0.05)
