To identify novel genes in appetite regulation from fat body, we used two-step screening method (Fig. 1a). For primary screening, we performed miRNA-based overexpression screen using fat body specific gene-switch driver S1106-Gal4 crossed to a library of 131 UAS-miRNA lines that generated in our lab \cite{Suh_2015}. For the measurement of changes in appetite behavior, we used modified capillary feeder (CAFE) assay \cite{Ja_2007} with 24hr habituation followed by 32hr measurement (Fig. 1b). From miRNA screening, we found that overexpression of miR-iab-4 in fat body increases ad lib feeding (Fig. 1c, d). Two different fat body specific drivers, S<sub>1</sub>106-Gal4\cite{Roman_2001} and r4-Gal4 \cite{Lee_2004}, both showed increased feeding, which confirm the importance of miR-iab-4 in fat body for appetite regulation (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1a).

To identify targets of miR-iab-4 in appetite regulation, we searched putative target genes of miR-iab-4 predicted by Targetscan (www.targetscan.org) and miRanda (www.microRNA.org). Among these, we performed secondary RNAi screening for 21 target genes that are highly expressed in fat body (Extended Data Table 1). From the secondary screening using RNAi lines, we identified gene _purple_ as new regulator of appetite behavior. We used two different pr-RNAi lines (UAS-pr-IR1 from Vienna Stock Center; UAS-pr-IR2 from Bloomington Stock Center) and both significantly enhanced _ad lib_ feeding (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1b). We also tested another fat body specific Gal4 line FB-Gal4 \cite{Gr_nke_2003}, which showed similar phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 1c). It is known that _pr_ is highly expressed in fly eyes \cite{Kim_2013}. When we knockdown pr specifically in eyes, however, animals showed normal feeding behavior (Extended Data Fig. 1d). It suggests that pr expression in eyes is not involved in feeding behavior. When we knockdown _pr_ in fat body only in adult stage, the animals still showed hyperphagic phenotype (Fig. 1f) suggesting that _pr_ expression in adult fat body is still important for the appetite regulation. 

To confirm the function of pr in appetitie behavior, we also tested two pr mutant lines and found they showed increased feeding phenotype (Fig. 1h). Since pr mutants showed hyperphagia, we asked whether the expression of pr on fat body is enough to rescue the phenotype. Without pr mutation, the over-expression of pr in fat body caused anorexic phenotype (Fig. 1h). When we express pr in fat body under the pr mutant background, flies showed significantly decreased feeding compare to other pr mutant controls (Fig. 1i). These data suggests that pr expression on fat body is critical for appetite regulation.
