1. Genome-wide miRNA screening in fat body reveals novel function of gene purple in feeding behavior

To identify novel genes in appetite regulation from fat body, we used two-step screening method (Figure 1A). For primary screening, we performed miRNA-based overexpression screen using fat body specific gene-switch driver S1106-Gal4 crossed to the library of 141 UAS-miRNA lines that generated in our lab (Suh et al., 2015). Since S1106-Gal4 is RU486 inducible gene-switch driver, we were able to overexpress miRNA only in adult stage by feeding RU486. For the measurement of changes in appetite behavior, we used modified capillary feeder (CAFE) assay (Ja et al., 2007) with 24hr habituation followed by 32hr measurement (Figure 1B). From miRNA screening, we found that overexpression of miR-iab-4 in fat body increases ad lib feeding (Figure 1C). Two different fat body specific drivers, S1106-Gal4 and r4-Gal4 (Lee & Park, 2004), both showed increased feeding, which confirm the importance of miR-iab-4 in fat body for appetite regulation (Figure 1D and 1E).

To identify targets of miR-iab-4 in appetite regulation, we searched putative target genes of miR-iab-4 predicted by Targetscan (www.targetscan.org) and miRanda (www.microRNA.org). Among these, we performed secondary RNAi screening for 21 target genes that are highly expressed in fat body (Table S1). From the secondary CAFE assay screening using RNAi lines, we identified gene purple as new regulator of appetite behavior. We used two different pr-RNAi lines(UAS-pr-IR1 from Vienna Stock Center; UAS-pr-IR2 from Bloomington Stock Center) and both significantly enhanced ad lib feeding (Figure 1F and Figure S1A). We also tested another fat body specific Gal4 line FB-Gal4 (Gronke et al., 2003) to confirm the phenotype (Fig. S1B).

Gene purple (pr) is named after its purple eye color of purple mutants and it is known that pr is highly expressed in fly eyes. When we knockdown pr specifically in eyes, animals showed normal feeding behavior (Figure S1C). It suggests that pr expression in eyes is not involved in feeding behavior. ]]

When we knockdown pr in fat body only in adult stage, the animals still showed hyperphagic phenotype (Figure 1G) suggesting that pr expression in adult fat body is also critical for the appetite regulation.


2. Gene pr involves in appetite behavior through Tetrahydrobiopterin(BH4) biosynthesis pathway

To confirm the function of pr in appetitie behavior, we test two pr mutant lines and found they also showed increased feeding phenotype (Figure 2B). Since pr mutants also showed hyperphagia, so asked whether the expression of pr on fat body could rescue the phenotype. Flies express pr by fat body driver r4-Ga4 under the pr mutant background showed significantly decreased feeding compare to other pr mutant controls (Figure 2D). The over-expression of pr without pr mutant background caused anorexic phenotype, suggesting that pr expression on fat body is critical for appetite regulation. 

To investigate the underneath mechanism of pr – related appetite regulation, we searched what gene product of pr is. Gene pr produces enzyme PTPS(6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthease), which is required to synthesize cofactor BH4 (6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin) (Figure 2A) (Thony et al., 2000;Werner et al., 2011). To explore functional correlation between pr and BH4, we monitored ad lib feeding of pr mutants after fed BH4-mixed sucrose solution for 24hours. Without BH4 pre-feeding, both pr mutants showed hyperphagic phenotype comparing with Canton-S and w1118 (Figure 2B and 2E).

 When we measured ad lib feeding after fed low amount of BH4 (0.17mg/ml), however, feeding amount of pr mutant flies were decreased almost same as controls in normal condition. The amount of feeding in controls also decreased after BH4 feeding, but the degree was negligible. After fed high amount of BH4 (0.34mg/ml), all mutants and control flies showed decreased feeding and pr mutant flies consumed similarly low amount of sucrose as control (Figure 2D). Low amount of BH4 feeding also rescued hyperphagia of r4-Gal4>UAS-pr-IR1 flies (Figure 2F). 

To confirm function of BH4 in appetite control, we test knockdown of gene punch (pu) in fat body, which is upstream gene of pr in BH4 synthesis. Using two different RNAi lines, we found that pu knockdown showed similar hyperphagia as pr knockdown (Figure 2G and S2A). Low amount of BH4 rescued hyperphagia of pu knockdown just same as in pr knockdown, which support that BH4 is involved in the regulation of ad lib feeding (Figure 2G). 

Since pr or pu knockdown flies eat more, we expect that they may have higher level of body fat. Consistent with our expectation, pr or pu knockdown flies were more resistant to starvation (Figure S2B and S2C), which is typical sign of high fat. When we checked changes in body fat after eclosion, there was no changes in Canton-S between day 1 and day 7, however, both pr mutants showed increased fat level (Figure S2D). Pr mutants and control did not show differences in metabolic rates, which is measured by the amount of CO2 generation in 1 hr (Figure S2E).



3. Final synthesis of BH4 requires brain, not fatbody, to regulate appetite behavior

The terminal reaction in the biosynthesis of BH4 requires Sepiapterin Reductase, which is generated from gene Sptr (Figure 2A). We investigated ad lib feeding of Sptr mutant flies. As expected, Sptr mutants also showed hyperphagia, which is rescuable by BH4 pre-feeding (Figure 3A). We hypothesized that pr over-expression on fat body may not rescue hyperphagia of Sptr mutant because Sptr is downstream of pr in the process of BH4 biosynthesis. Consistent with our hypothesis, adult specific over-expression of pr on fat body does not reduce feeding amount when the flies have Sptr mutant background, even though same pr over-expression showed decreased feeding in normal condition (Figure 3B and S3A). 

Next, we investigated Sptr knockdown on fat body to verify its effect on appetite behavior. To our surprise, we did not observe any increases in feeding from three different Sptr-IR lines. We also observed normal feeding behavior from Sptr knockdown using other fat body driver FB-Gal4(Figure S3B). We test Dhfr knockdown, which is known to involve in salvage pathway of BH4 biosynthesis (Figure S3C), but it was also normal (Figure S3D). We observed hyperphagia using whole-body driver Act5C-Gal4 (Figure S4A), meaning that knockdown itself is effective. Next, we tried pan-neuronal driver elav-Gal4 because appetite behavior is controlled by neurons after all. Surprisingly, Sptr knockdown in whole neuron showed increased feeding (Figure 3D and S3E). Peptidergic neuronal driver 386Y-Gal4 also showed increased feeding (Figure 3E). Since pr knockdown on brain does not show increased feeding (Figure 3F), we concluded that pr expression and Sptr expression are supposed to happen in two different places as in fat body and in brain for the regulation of appetite behavior.

We tested involvement of of eye on the process, but Sptr knockdown on eyes did not show the phenotype (Figure S3F)]]


4. BH4 function in appetite regulation requires NPF expressing neurons 



To identify Sptr expressing neurons for appetite regulation, we performed another set of CAFE screening using UAS-Sptr-IR lines and known feeding-related Gal4 lines (Figure S4)(). To our surprise, we observed similar feeding phenotype when we knockdown Sptr in NPF expressing neurons. We tested three UAS-Sptr-RNAi lines and all of them showed hyperphagia (Figure 4A, S5A and S5B). BH4 feeding, similar as tested on fat body, rescued hyperphagia of NPF-Gal4>UAS-Sptr-IR flies (Figure 4A and S5A). NPF specific Sptr knockdown flies showed longer survival in starvation, suggesting they accumulated more fat because they ate more. We tested knockdown of Dhfr, which is known to be involved in salvage pathway. But result wasn’t clear (Figure S5D), probably because it is not necessary for the BH4 synthesis. Knockdown of pr or pu in NPF neurons did not cause any changes in feeding amount (Figure 4C and S5E), supporting that pu and pr are expressed not in NPF but in fat body to control ad lib feeding behavior. To further confirm the location of Sptr expression, we expressed Sptr gene in NPF neurons under the Sptr mutant background.  In non-permissive temperature (18oC), all flies having Sptr mutant background ate more than control (Figure S5F). However, when we increase temperature (30oC) and let NPF-Gal4 express Sptr in NPF neurons, hyperphagia was rescued and flies ate much less than controls even though they are under Sptr mutant background (Figure 4D). 


5. BH4 regulates appetite behavior by inhibiting NPF release 


NPF neuron is known to involved in sweet taste sensation (Inagaki et al., 2014). To investigate whether NPF signaling is the target of BH4 action for the control of feeding, we knockdown NPF gene in NPF neuron and test the changes of appetite behavior. We observed that NPF knockdown shows decreased feeding (Figure 5A). The result was consistent with the appetite behavior of NPF receptor mutant files (Figure 5B). 

(Hypothetical)To confirm that the involvement of NPF signal in BH4 action, we knockdown Sptr gene on NPF neuron under NPFR mutant background. When NPF signal is impaired by receptor mutantion, Sptr knockdown does not induce hyperphagia, suggesting that NPF is the target of BH4.


In previous research, BH4 is involved in biochemical reactions to generate Nitric oxide (NO), tyrosine, dopamine, serotonin, and ether lipids (Werner et al., 2011;Kim et al., 2015). To investigate whether these reactions happen in NPF neurons to regulate appetite behavior, we test knockdown of genes for NO, tyrosine, dopamine, and serotonin synthesis. We did not observe any changes in appetite behavior (Figure S6A-S6H). We could not test the possibility of ether lipids because homological gene for enzyme (alkylglycerol mono-oxygenase, AGMO) is not known in Drosophila. 

BH4 is known as a cofactor, which helps the reaction. However, our data suggests that high BH4 mimics NPF knockdown (Figure S6I and 5A). To verify the effect of BH4 on NPF change, we feed high dose of BH4 and stained NPF neurons with NPF antibody. We found that relatively low NPF staining from Sptr-knockdown animal and extremely high staining from BH4-fed animal (Figure 5D). These changes of NPF level were not from changes in NPF gene expressions (Figure 5E). Therefore we confirm that BH4 works as an inhibitor and blocks release of NPF to regulate appetite behavior. Interestingly, activation of NPF neuron by the expression of bacterial sodium channel, NaChBac, negates the effect of BH4 even in high amount (Figure 5F). This data suggests BH4 involved in inactivation of NPF neuron, so NPF would not released.
