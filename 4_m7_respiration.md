### Measuring respiration

Measurement of metabolic rate using CO2 production was performed by standard technique (Yatsenko et al., 2014) with modification as follows: we used three of 7-day old males in a 2ml centrifuge tube as fly container with soda lime (Wako Inc., Japan). And 20Î¼l Marienfeld capillary tube (Germany) was connected to the container with rubber cap. Container with no flies was used for blank. Blue-colored water was loaded at the tip of capillary and wait 30min for equilibration. Movement of water position for the next 1 hour was measured as CO2 generation.
