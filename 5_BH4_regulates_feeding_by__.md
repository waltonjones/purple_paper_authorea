BH4 regulates feeding by inhibiting NPF release 

NPF neuron is known to involved in sweet taste sensation (Inagaki et al., 2014). To investigate whether NPF signaling is the target of BH4 action for the control of feeding, we knockdown NPF gene in NPF neuron and test the changes of appetite behavior. We observed that NPF knockdown shows decreased feeding (Figure 5A). The result was consistent with the appetite behavior of NPF receptor mutant files (Figure 5B). 
(Hypothetical)To confirm that the involvement of NPF signal in BH4 action, we knockdown Sptr gene on NPF neuron under NPFR mutant background. When NPF signal is impaired by receptor mutantion, Sptr knockdown does not induce hyperphagia, suggesting that NPF is the target of BH4. 
In previous research, BH4 is involved in biochemical reactions to generate Nitric oxide (NO), tyrosine, dopamine, serotonin, and ether lipids (Werner et al., 2011;Kim et al., 2015). To investigate whether these reactions happen in NPF neurons to regulate appetite behavior, we test knockdown of genes for NO, tyrosine, dopamine, and serotonin synthesis. We did not observe any changes in appetite behavior (Figure S6A-S6H). We could not test the possibility of ether lipids because homological gene for enzyme (alkylglycerol mono-oxygenase, AGMO) is not known in Drosophila. 

BH4 is known as a cofactor, which helps the reaction. However, our data suggests that high BH4 mimics NPF knockdown (Figure S6I and 5A). To verify the effect of BH4 on NPF change, we feed high dose of BH4 and stained NPF neurons with NPF antibody. We found that relatively low NPF staining from Sptr-knockdown animal and extremely high staining from BH4-fed animal (Figure 5D). These changes of NPF level were not from changes in NPF gene expressions (Figure 5E). Therefore we confirm that BH4 works as an inhibitor and blocks release of NPF to regulate appetite behavior. Interestingly, activation of NPF neuron by the expression of bacterial sodium channel, NaChBac, negates the effect of BH4 even in high amount (Figure 5F). This data suggests BH4 involved in inactivation of NPF neuron, so NPF would not released.
