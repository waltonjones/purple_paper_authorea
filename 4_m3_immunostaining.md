## Immunostaining

We carried out whole-mount brain immunofluorescence as previously described \cite{Laissue_1999} using an anti-NPF primary antibody at 0.05 μg/μl (RayBiotech (RB-19-001), USA) and a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000, Life technologies, USA). We imaged the brains with a 20X objective on an LSM780 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany) and quantified staining intensities of individual cells using ImageJ.
