### Immunohistochemistry and intensity measurement

Whole-mount brain immunofluorescence was carried out as previously described \cite{Laissue_1999} using an anti-NPF primary antibody at 0.05 μg/μl (RayBiotech (RB-19-001), USA) and a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000, Life technologies, USA). Brains were imaged with a 20X objective on an LSM780 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany). We quantified staining intensities of individual cells using ImageJ.
