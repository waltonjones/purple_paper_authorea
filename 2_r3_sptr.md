Next, we investigated _Sptr_ knockdown on fat body to verify its effect on appetite behavior. To our surprise, we did not observe any increases in feeding from three different Sptr-IR lines (Fig. 4A). We also observed normal feeding behavior from _Sptr_ knockdown using other fat body driver FB-Gal4 (Fig S1B). So, we tried pan-neuronal driver elav-Gal4 because appetite behavior is controlled by neurons after all. Surprisingly, _Sptr_ knockdown in whole neuron showed increased feeding (Fig. 4B and S1C). Since _pr_ knockdown on brain does not show increased feeding (Fig. S1D), we concluded that _pr_ expression and _Sptr_ expression are supposed to happen in two different places as in fat body and in brain for the regulation of appetite behavior. This means intermediate metabolite 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PTP) suppose to be transfered from fat to brain, possibly through hemolymph. 

After we found that brain is the place where Sptr is critical for appetite regulation, we tested diverse feeding-related locations to pinpoint the target neurons (Fig. S2). Among these, we found that _Sptr_ knockdown on NPF expressing neurons shows increased feeding. We tested three UAS-Sptr-RNAi lines and all of them showed hyperphagia (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). BH4 feeding, similar as the result from fat body, rescued hyperphagia of NPF-Gal4>UAS-Sptr-IR flies (Fig. 4C, and S3A and B). Adult specific _Sptr_ knockdown in NPF neurons also showed increased feeding, suggesting BH4 is important in the adult appetite behavior through NPF neurons (Fig. 4D). However,knockdown of _pr_ or _Pu_ in NPF neurons did not cause any changes in feeding amount (Fig. 4E and S3C), supporting that these are expressed not in NPF but in fat body to control _ad lib_ feeding behavior. 

To further confirm the location of Sptr expression, we expressed _Sptr_ in NPF neurons under the _Sptr_ mutant background.  In permissive temperature (18ºC), all flies having _Sptr_ mutant background ate more than control (Fig. 4F top). However, when we increase temperature (30ºC) and let NPF-Gal4 express Sptr in NPF neurons, hyperphagia was rescued only in test flies and they ate much less than _Sptr_ mutant controls even though they are under _Sptr_ mutant background (Fig. 4F bottom). When we over-express Sptr in NPF in normal genetic background, flies ate less as expected (Fig. S3D).
