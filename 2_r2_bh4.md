To investigate the underneath mechanism of _purple_ â€“ related appetite regulation, we searched what gene product of _pr_ is. Gene _pr_ produces enzyme PTPS(6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthease), which is required to synthesize cofactor BH4 (6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin) (Fig. 3A)\cite{TH_NY_2000, Werner_2011}. To explore functional correlation between _pr_ and BH4, we monitored _ad lib_ feeding of _pr_ mutants after fed BH4-mixed sucrose solution during habituation (Fig. 3B). When we measured _ad lib_ feeding after fed low amount of BH4 (0.17mg/ml), feeding amount of _pr_ mutant flies were decreased almost same as controls in normal condition. The amount of feeding in controls also decreased after BH4 feeding, but the degree was negligible. After fed high amount of BH4 (0.34mg/ml), all mutants and control flies showed decreased feeding and _pr_ mutant flies consumed similarly low amount of sucrose as control. Low amount of BH4 feeding also rescued hyperphagia of r4-Gal4>UAS-pr-IR1 flies (Fig. 3C), supporting BH4 is involved in appetite regulation.

To confirm the function of BH4 in appetite control, we test knockdown of gene _Punch_ (_Pu_) in fat body, which is upstream gene of _pr_ in BH4 synthesis. Using two different RNAi lines, we found that _Pu_ knockdown showed similar hyperphagia as _pr_ knockdown (Fig. 3D and S1A). Increased feeding of _Pu_ knockdown was rescued by BH4 feeding (Fig. 3D). The terminal reaction in the biosynthesis of BH4 requires Sepiapterin Reductase (Sptr). To test the downsteam of pr, we checked appetite behavior of _Sptr_ mutant flies, which also showed increased feeding and rescued by BH4 pre-feeding (Fig. 3E). After we observed increased feeding phenotype from _Sptr_ mutant flies, We hypothesized that _pr_ over-expression on fat body may not rescue hyperphagia of _Sptr_ mutant because Sptr is downstream of Pr in the process of BH4 biosynthesis. Consistent with our hypothesis, adult specific over-expression of _pr_ on fat body does not reduce feeding amount when the flies have _Sptr_ mutant background, even though same _pr_ over-expression showed decreased feeding in normal background condition (Fig. 3F).
