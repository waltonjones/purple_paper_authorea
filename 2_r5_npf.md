## BH4 induces satiety by inhibiting the NPF neurons
Lastly, we explored the mechanism by which BH4 functions in the NPF neurons to regulate feeding.
NPF is the closest fly homologue of the mammalian appetite regulator NPY \cite{Brown_1999}.
Although NPF plays a clear role in extending the foraging phase of larval development \cite{Wu_2003}, to our knowledge the extent to which NPF loss-of-function affects adult _ad libitum_ feeding amount is unknown.
As expected, knock-down of NPF in the NPF neurons reduces adult _ad libitum_ feeding (Fig. 5A).
Consistent with this result, two different homozygous NPF receptor mutants, _NPFR<sup>c01896</sup>_ and _NPFR<sup>MI08636</sup>_, eat less than their heterozygous controls (Fig. 5B).
If the role of BH4 in the regulation of feeding acts via NPF-NPFR signaling, NPFR loss-of-function should mask the increase in feeding caused by NPF neuron-specific loss of _Sptr_.
Indeed, in the _NPFR<sup>c01896</sup>_ mutant background, flies whose NPF neurons express the Sptr-IR3 transgene eat the same as heterozygous controls and less than control flies with wild-type NPFR (Fig. 5C).

BH4 is a required cofactor of Nitric oxide synthase (Nos) and of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases required to produce dopamine and serotonin \cite{Werner_2011}.
These well-established relationships suggested a possible mechanism for the role of BH4 in feeding regulation.
Contrary to our expectations, NPF neuron-specific knock-down of each of these enzymes—Nos, Tryptophan hydroxylase (Trh), pale (Tyrosine hydroxylase), and Henna (Phenylalanine hydroxylase)—using two different inverted repeat (IR) lines each causes no change in feeding behavior (Fig. S4).

Since we have shown that the effect of BH4 on feeding acts via NPF-NPFR signaling, we next visualized the effects of BH4 manipulation on NPF levels in the adult brain using an NPF-specific antibody.
Considering their increased appetite, it is unsurprising that, when compared to a heterozygous control (Fig. 5D–E, above), flies with reduced levels of _Sptr_ in their NPF neurons also show reduced staining of NPF (Fig. 5D–E, middle).
These neurons are effectively releasing NPF to up-regulate appetite.
We next observed that pre-feeding these same flies with high dose BH4 (0.34 mg/ml) dramatically increases NPF staining in the NPF neurons (Fig. 5D-E, below).
By extracting total head RNA from these same flies and performing a qPCR experiment, it became clear that these changes in NPF staining are not a result of a significant change in NPF gene expression (Fig. 5F).
This suggests that BH4 is inhibiting NPF release—either directly or by strongly inhibiting the firing of the NPF neurons.

To distinguish these two possibilities, we artificially activated the NPF neurons using the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac.
To rule out any developmental artifacts caused by constitutive NPF neuron activation, we added the temperature-sensitive GAL80.
At 18ºC, all genotypes eat similar amounts, more without and less with high dose BH4 pre-feeding (Fig. 5G, above).
At 30ºC, flies with hyper-activated NPF neurons eat much more than the appropriate heterozygous controls regardless of BH4 pre-feeding (Fig. 5G, below).
The presence of NaChBac overcomes the effect of high dose BH4 pre-feeding, meaning the NPF neurons are still releasing NPF.
BH4, thus, acts by inhibiting the firing of the NPF neurons.
Further experiments will be necessary to determine whether the inhibition of the NPF neurons is a direct hyper-polarization of their membrane potential or is acting via a negative feedback circuit.
