Finally, we sought to explore the mechanism by which BH4 functions in the NPF neurons to regulate feeding.
NPF is the closest fly homologue of the mammalian appetite regulator NPY \cite{Brown_1999}.
Although the role of NPF in feeding has been explored to some extent in *Drosophila* larvae \cite{Wu_2003}, to our knowledge the extent to which NPF loss-of-function affects adult *ad libitum* feeding amount has never been measured. 
As expected, knock-down of *NPF* in the NPF neurons reduces adult *ad libitum* feeding (Fig. 5A). 
Consistent with this result, two different homozygous NPF receptor mutants, *NPFR<sup>c01896</sup>* and *NPFR<sup>MI08636</sup>*, eat less than their heterozygous controls (Fig. 5B). If the role of BH4 in the regulation of feeding acts via NPF-NPFR signaling, the increase in feeding caused by loss of *Sptr* in the NPF neurons should be masked by NPFR loss-of-function.
Indeed, in the *NPFR<sup>c01896</sup>* mutant background, flies whose NPF neurons express the Sptr-IR3 transgene eat the same as heterozygous controls and less than control flies lacking the NPFR mutation (Fig. 5C).

In previous research, BH4 is involved in biochemical reactions to generate nitric oxide (NO), tyrosine, dopamine, serotonin \cite{Werner_2011, Kim_2015}. 
To investigate whether these reactions happen in NPF neurons to regulate appetite behavior, we test knockdown of genes for NO, tyrosine, dopamine, and serotonin synthesis. 
We did not observe any changes in appetite behavior (Fig. S4). 

BH4 is known as a cofactor, which helps the reaction. 
However, our data suggests that high BH4 mimics the less eating phenotype of NPF knockdown. 
To verify the effect of BH4 on NPF change, we feed high dose of BH4 and stained NPF neurons with NPF antibody. 
We found that relatively low NPF staining from Sptr-knockdown animals. 
Interestingly, same genotype flies show extremely high staining after BH4 feeding (Fig. 5D and E). 
These changes in NPF levels were not from changes in NPF gene expressions (Fig. 5F). 
This data imply that NPF does not released from cell body when BH4 is high. 
More interestingly, activation of NPF neuron by the expression of bacterial sodium channel, NaChBac, negates the effect of BH4 even in high dose (Fig. 5G). 
This data suggests BH4 involved in inactivation of NPF neuron, so NPF would not released.
