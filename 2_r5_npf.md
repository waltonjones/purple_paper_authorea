Finally, we sought to explore the mechanism by which BH4 functions in the NPF neurons to regulate feeding.
NPF is the closest fly homologue of the mammalian appetite regulator NPY \cite{Brown_1999}.
Although the role of NPF in feeding has been explored to some extent in *Drosophila* larvae \cite{Wu_2003}, to our knowledge the extent to which NPF loss-of-function affects adult *ad libitum* feeding amount has never been measured. 
As expected, knock-down of *NPF* in the NPF neurons reduces adult *ad libitum* feeding (Fig. 5A). 
Consistent with this result, two different homozygous NPF receptor mutants, *NPFR<sup>c01896</sup>* and *NPFR<sup>MI08636</sup>*, eat less than their heterozygous controls (Fig. 5B).
If the role of BH4 in the regulation of feeding acts via NPF-NPFR signaling, the increase in feeding caused by loss of *Sptr* in the NPF neurons should be masked by NPFR loss-of-function.
Indeed, in the *NPFR<sup>c01896</sup>* mutant background, flies whose NPF neurons express the Sptr-IR3 transgene eat the same as heterozygous controls and less than control flies lacking the NPFR mutation (Fig. 5C).

BH4 is a required cofactor of Nitric oxide synthase (Nos) and of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases that are required to produce dopamine and serotonin \cite{Werner_2011}. 
These well-established relationships suggested a possible mechanism for the role of BH4 in feeding regulation.
Unfortunately, NPF neuron-specific knock-down of each of these enzymes---Nos, Tryptophan hydroxylase (Trh), pale (Tyrosine hydroxylase), and Henna (Phenylalanine hydroxylase)---using two different inverted repeat (IR) lines causes no change in feeding behavior (Fig. S4). 

Since we have shown that the effect of BH4 on feeding acts via NPF-NPFR signaling, we next visualized the effects of BH4 manipulation on NPF levels in the adult brain using an NPF-specific antibody. 
Considering their increased appetite, it is perhaps unsurprising that, when compared to a heterozygous control (Fig. 5D--E, above), flies with reduced levels of *Sptr* in their NPF neurons also show reduced staining of NPF (Fig. 5D-E, middle).
The NPF is being released effectively to up-regulate appetite.
We next observed that pre-feeding these same flies with high dose BH4 (0.34 mg/ml) dramatically increases NPF staining in the NPF neurons (Fig. 5D-E, below).
By extracting total head RNA from these same flies and performing a qPCR experiment, it became clear that these changes in NPF staining are not a result of a significant change in NPF gene expression (Fig. 5F). 
This suggests that BH4 is inhibiting NPF release---either directly or by strongly inhibiting the firing of the NPF neurons. 

To distinguish these two possibilities, we artificially activated the NPF neurons using the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac.
To eliminate any developmental artifacts caused by constitutive NPF neuron activation, we added the temperature-sensitive GAL80.
At 18ºC, all genotypes eat similar amounts, more without and less with high dose BH4 pre-feeding (Fig. 5G, above).
At 30ºC, however, flies with hyper-activated NPF neurons eat much more than the appropriate heterozygous controls regardless of BH4 pre-feeding (Fig. 5G, below).
The presence of NaChBac overcomes the effect of high dose BH4 pre-feeding, meaning the NPF neurons are still releasing NPF.
BH4, thus, acts by inhibiting the firing of the NPF neurons.
Further experiments will be necessary to determine whether the inhibition of the NPF neurons is a direct hyper-polarization on membrane potential or is acting via some sort of feedback circuit.
