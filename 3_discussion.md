From the screening and followed studies, we identified new appetite-related functions of gene pu, pr, Sptr and its biochemical product BH4 (Fig. 4g). Gene pr is named after purplish eye color of its mutant, because pr is highly expressed in eyes to generate red-eye pigments \cite{Kim_1995}. We suspected that pr in eyes may also effect on NPF because of their physical closeness. However, our data suggests there is no effect of pr knockdown in eyes on feeding. Interestingly, pr produces two different transcripts \cite{8846895}.  The 1.1 kb transcript is head specific and is highly expressed during eclosion when eye pigmentation happens. The 1.3 kb large transcript is expressed constitutively for BH4 synthesis \cite{Kim_2013}. Differential transcription of pr may explain lack of effect from eye specific pr knockdown.

Cofactor BH4 is required in diverse tissues \cite{Werner_2011}, but it shows different functions in different tissues. For example, it is critical for pain sensitivity in sensory neurons \cite{Latremoliere_2015}. BH4 is known to involved in diverse enzymatic reactions but involvement in appetite control was not suggested. This is presumably because murine models of pr or sptr mutants showed severe developmental defects. Pr-/- died in 48 hours after birth \cite{Sumi_Ichinose_2001} and Sptr-/- showed severe dwarfism because of severe defect in dopamine synthesis \cite{Yang_2006}. Our data suggests that BH4 in NPF neurons may have novel function in appetite control.

Our data shows that functionally related genes – Pu, pr and Sptr – are expressed in two different locations – fat body and NPF neurons – to control eating. Decreased feeding by the expression of genes - Pu and pr - in hemolymph suggests the intermediate prodcut PTP is transferred through hemolymph. Humoral link between fat body and brain is previouely reported for the control of insulin secretion \cite{G_minard_2009}. But the transporting intermediate metabolite is totally unknown before.


Drosophila NPF, homolog of mammalian NPY, is known to involve in feeding \cite{Wu_2003,Inagaki_2014}. We found that NPF neurons receive information from fat body and change ad lib appetite behavior. Interestingly, NPF release is inhibited after high amount of BH4 feeding, which is unexpected because known function of BH4 is cofactor. It is possible that BH4 may have inhibitory function in NPF neurons, or BH4 stimulates production of other unknown hormone, which inhibits NPF release. Detailed mechanism of BH4 in NPF neuron remains to be known.

In conclusion, our data illustrates that NPF regulates feeding behavior according to BH4, which is remotely regulated by body fat. It may shed light on mechanism underlying regulation of feeding behavior by changes in body weight.
