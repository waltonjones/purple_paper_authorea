This study began with a genetic screen for fat-derived modulators of feeding.
In this screen, we identified a new function for the enzymatic co-factor BH4 and thus the enzymes required to produce it (i.e., Punch, Purple, and Sptr) in reducing appetite in adult _Drosophila_.
We found that while appetite regulation requires Punch and Purple expression in the fat body, it requires Sptr expression in the brain.
We also found that pre-feeding flies BH4 rescues the increases in feeding caused by loss-of-function of Punch and Purple in the fat body and Sptr in the brain.
Thus, the steps in the biosynthesis of the BH4 required for appetite regulation are physically distributed between the fat body and the brain, implying the circulation of a fat body-derived PTP intermediate (Fig. 6).

Despite Punch and Purple each catalyzing reactions that create small molecule intermediates that could readily circulate through the hemolymph of the open insect circulatory system, there seems to be a strong tissue specificity to their expression patterns.
The developing eyes are the sites of highest expression of both Punch and Purple where they function in drosopterin eye pigment production rather than BH4 production.
The _punch_ locus produces at least three transcripts that each show temporal and tissue-specific expression patterns as well as differential regulation by BH4 \cite{Funderburk_2006}.
The _purple_ locus produces two transcripts \cite{8846895}â€”one is eye-specific for pigment production and the other is more broadly expressed (e.g., in the fat body) for BH4 synthesis \cite{Kim_2013}.
Again, according to our results, PTP produced in the fat body by the successive action of Punch and Purple seems to circulate for conversion to BH4 by Sptr in the NPF neurons.
Our results also imply that the PTP produced by Punch and Purple in the eye does not circulate for conversion to BH4 by Sptr in the NPF neurons.
This could be because the PTP to drosopterin conversion occurs too fast or because the fat body expresses an unknown PTP transporter that is missing in the eye.
Regardless, the fat body-specific expression of Purple and Punch necessary for appetite regulation makes it tempting to speculate that fat-derived PTP may signal an energy replete status to the brain reducing the drive to eat.
It will be interesting in the future to see whether the expression or activity of either Punch or Purple in the fat body changes with fat storage volume or lipolysis.

Considering the feeding phenotypes caused by fat body-specific knock-down of Punch and Purple, the lack of any phenotype caused by fat body-specific knock-down of Sptr surprised us.
Still, after a small targeted screen of neuronal GAL4 lines we were able to narrow the necessary feeding-related expression of Sptr to two pairs of bilaterally symmetric dorsolateral brain neurons expressing the neuropeptide NPF.
Since FlyAtlas data reveal moderate expression of Sptr in the brain, these four NPF neurons are almost certainly not the only Sptr-positive neurons.
It will be interesting to identify other Sptr-positive neurons and determine whether they also contribute to appetite regulation or other behavioral phenotypes.
If other Sptr-positive neurons do exist, the inability of the Sptr they produce to compensate for the knock-down of Sptr in the NPF neurons suggests the locations that require BH4 must produce it directly themselves.
This is either because BH4 does not circulate at all or because it is rapidly degraded when it does.
We did observe successful rescues with BH4 pre-feeding, but this means only that exogenous BH4 can get into the cells that need it, not that it can get out.
We hope future experiments will clarify the intricacies of the Sptr expression pattern in the brain and how such a global intervention as feeding the flies BH4 achieves what seems to be such a specific rescue in the NPF neurons.

Once we implicated the NPF neurons, we began to investigate possible mechanisms underlying their role in the BH4-dependent regulation of feeding.
Through a combination of genetic techniques aimed at altering the firing rate of the NPF neurons we were able to determine that BH4 inhibits the NPF neurons and their release of NPF, but the mechanism by which it does so is still unclear.
Although the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases as well as nitric oxide synthase are known to require BH4 as a co-factor, we were unable to observe any changes in feeding induced by NPF neuron-specific knock-down of any of these enzymes (Fig. S4).
It is possible that BH4 acts in the NPF neurons as a co-factor of some unknown enzyme.
It is also possible, although unlikely considering the strength of the NPF GAL4 line, that the knock-down of the known BH4-dependent enzymes was insufficient.
In the future, we hope to clarify this mechanism by which BH4 inhibits the NPF neurons.

The enzymes that act in the BH4 biosynthetic pathway are all well-studied, at least in part because their mutations lead to phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalanemia in humans.
The severe developmental abnormalities observed in these diseases stem mainly from a toxic build-up of phenylalanine and an absence of aromatic amino acids like dopamine and serotonin.
 \cite{Werner_2011}.
 Murine models of BH4 deficiencies also show severe developmental defects.
 PTPS (Purple) mutant mouse pups die within 48 hours after birth \cite{Sumi_Ichinose_2001} and the loss of dopamine in SPR (Sptr) mutant mice leads to severe dwarfism \cite{Yang_2006}.
It may be puzzling that the BH4-deficiency phenotypes we observe in flies are so much more mild than those observed in mice and humans, but it is important to note that the fly phenotypes we have observed are not caused by total loss-of-function.
Using a temperature-sensitive GAL80, we were also able to temporally limit many of our knock-down experiments to the adult stage.
Since the enzymes that produce BH4 and the enzymes that require BH4 are all highly conserved, it will be interesting to see whether our results in flies also apply to mice or humans.
It is possible, for example, that mutations affecting individual enhancers of a gene like human SPR (Sptr) could reduce its expression in limited populations of neurons, causing subtle behavioral phenotypes.
This would mean the severity of the known BH4-deficient syndromes is masking much less severe but important phenotypes.
Perhaps further experiments in flies will be useful in directing a more careful examination of mouse models of BH4-deficiency as well.
