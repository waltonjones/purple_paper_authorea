## Statistics

All boxplots in this study follow the standard Tukey style. We determine statistical significance by performing ANOVA analyses followed by pairwise t-tests, correcting for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method. Statistically significant results are designated with asterisks (*** _P_ ≤ 0.001, ** _P_ ≤ 0.01, * _P_ ≤ 0.05). In all figures, the _P_ values of relevant statistical comparisons labeled with "n.s." fell below these thresholds and are therefore non-significant. All statistical analysis and figure generation was performed in R \cite{R}.
