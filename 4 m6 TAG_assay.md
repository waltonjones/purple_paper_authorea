**TAG assay**

For TAG assays, 18 adult male flies of each genotype were homogenized and followed standard protocol (Palanker et al., 2009) using DU 730 Spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, USA). TAG amount were determined by subtracting the amount of free glycerol in the PBS-treated sample from the total glycerol present in the sample treated with Triglyceride reagent (Serum Triglyceride Determination Kit; Sigma TR0100). TAG levels were normalized to protein amounts in each homogenate using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).
