Gene pr involves in feeding through BH4

To confirm the function of pr in appetitie behavior, we test two pr mutant lines and found they also showed increased feeding phenotype (Figure 2B). Since pr mutants also showed hyperphagia, we asked whether the expression of pr on fat body could rescue the phenotype. Without pr mutation, the over-expression of pr in fat body caused anorexic phenotype. When we express pr in fat body under the pr mutant background, flies showed significantly decreased feeding compare to other pr mutant controls (Figure 2D). These data suggests that pr expression on fat body is critical for appetite regulation. 

To investigate the underneath mechanism of pr â€“ related appetite regulation, we searched what gene product of pr is. Gene pr produces enzyme PTPS(6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthease), which is required to synthesize cofactor BH4 (6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin) (Figure 2A)\cite{TH_NY_2000}\cite{Werner_2011}. To explore functional correlation between pr and BH4, we monitored ad lib feeding of pr mutants after fed BH4-mixed sucrose solution for 24hours. When we measured ad lib feeding after fed low amount of BH4 (0.17mg/ml),surprisingly, feeding amount of pr mutant flies were decreased almost same as controls in normal condition. The amount of feeding in controls also decreased after BH4 feeding, but the degree was negligible. After fed high amount of BH4 (0.34mg/ml), all mutants and control flies showed decreased feeding and pr mutant flies consumed similarly low amount of sucrose as control (Figure 2E). Low amount of BH4 feeding also rescued hyperphagia of r4-Gal4>UAS-pr-IR1 flies (Figure 2F), supporting BH4 is involved in appetite regulation.

To confirm function of BH4 in appetite control, we test knockdown of gene punch (pu) in fat body, which is upstream gene of pr in BH4 synthesis. Using two different RNAi lines, we found that pu knockdown showed similar hyperphagia as pr knockdown (Figure 2G and S2A). Low amount of BH4 rescued hyperphagia of pu knockdown just same as in pr knockdown, which support that BH4 is involved in the regulation of ad lib feeding (Figure 2G). 

Since pr or pu knockdown flies eat more, we expect that they may have higher level of body fat. Consistent with our expectation, pr or pu knockdown flies were more resistant to starvation (Figure S2B and S2C), which is typical sign of high fat. When we checked changes in body fat after eclosion, there was no changes in Canton-S between day 1 and day 7, however, both pr mutants showed increased fat level (Figure S2D). Pr mutants and controls did not show differences in metabolic rates, which is measured by the amount of CO2 generation (Figure S2E).
