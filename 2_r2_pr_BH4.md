To investigate the underneath mechanism of pr â€“ related appetite regulation, we searched what gene product of pr is. Gene pr produces enzyme PTPS(6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthease), which is required to synthesize cofactor BH4 (6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin) (Fig. 2a)\cite{TH_NY_2000,cite{Werner_2011}. To explore functional correlation between pr and BH4, we monitored ad lib feeding of pr mutants after fed BH4-mixed sucrose solution during habituation. When we measured ad lib feeding after fed low amount of BH4 (0.17mg/ml), surprisingly, feeding amount of pr mutant flies were decreased almost same as controls in normal condition. The amount of feeding in controls also decreased after BH4 feeding, but the degree was negligible. After fed high amount of BH4 (0.34mg/ml), all mutants and control flies showed decreased feeding and pr mutant flies consumed similarly low amount of sucrose as control (Fig. 2b). Low amount of BH4 feeding also rescued hyperphagia of r4-Gal4>UAS-pr-IR1 flies (Fig. 2c), supporting BH4 is involved in appetite regulation.

To confirm function of BH4 in appetite control, we test knockdown of gene punch (Pu) in fat body, which is upstream gene of pr in BH4 synthesis. Using two different RNAi lines, we found that Pu knockdown showed similar hyperphagia as pr knockdown (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Increased feeding of Pu knockdown was rescued by BH4 feeding (Fig. 2d). The terminal reaction in the biosynthesis of BH4 requires Sepiapterin Reductase, which is generated from gene Sptr. To test the downsteam of pr, we checked appetite behavior of Sptr mutant flies, which also showed increased feeding and rescued by BH4 pre-feeding (Fig. 2e). After we observed increased feeding phenotype from Sptr mutant flies, We hypothesized that pr over-expression on fat body may not rescue hyperphagia of Sptr mutant because Sptr is downstream of pr in the process of BH4 biosynthesis. Consistent with our hypothesis, adult specific over-expression of pr on fat body does not reduce feeding amount when the flies have Sptr mutant background, even though same pr over-expression showed decreased feeding in normal background condition (Fig. 2f). Since pr or pu knockdown flies eat more, we expected that they may have higher level of body fat. Consistent with our expectation, pr or pu knockdown flies were more resistant to starvation (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c), which is typical sign of high fat.
