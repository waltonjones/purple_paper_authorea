We next asked whether the role of _Sptr_ in appetite regulation is, like that of _Pu_ and _pr_, specific to the fat body.
To our surprise, we were unable to observe any changes in feeding despite combining three different Sptr-IR lines with the fat body-specific drivers r4-GAL4 (Fig. 4A) or FB-Gal4 (Fig S1B).
Since feeding behavior is ultimately directed by the brain, we next used the pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 to knock-down _Sptr_ in all post-mitotic neurons.
We found that, indeed, neuron-specific knock-down of _Sptr_ does increase feeding (Fig. 4B and S1C).
After confirming pan-neuronal knock-down of _pr_ has no effect on feeding (Fig. S1D), it became clear that the steps in the biosynthesis of the BH4 required for proper appetite control are physically distributed between the fat body and the brain.
This suggests the intermediate metabolite PTP circulates, probably via the hemolymph, from its site of origin in the fat to its site of conversion to BH4 in the brain.

Next, we screened a group of neuronal GAL4 lines to more precisely define the _Sptr_-positive neurons that regulate feeding (Fig. S2).
_Sptr_ knock-down with both the ubiquitous Actin-5C driver (Act5C-GAL4) and the "pan-peptidergic" driver (386Y-GAL4) increase feeding (Fig. S2A–B).
Knock-down of _Sptr_ using the broad dopaminergic (TH-GAL4) and serotonergic (Trh-GAL4) drivers as well as the "obesity blocking neuron" driver (c673a-GAL4) \cite{Al_Anzi_2009}, the insulin-producing cell driver (dilp2-GAL4), the oenocyte driver (OK72-GAL4), and the feeding related peptidergic neuron drivers sNPF-GAL4 and AstA-GAL4 do not affect feeding amount (Fig. S2C–I).
We did observe hyperphagia, however, when we combined a GAL4 driver that labels the small group of neurons that express the neuropeptide NPF with each of three different Sptr-IR lines (Fig. 4C, and S3A–B).
As expected, pre-feeding these flies with a low dose of BH4 rescues this hyperphagia as well (Fig. 4C and S3A).
To rule out the possibility that this phenotype is a developmental artifact, we limited the knock-down of _Sptr_ to adult NPF neurons by adding the ubiquitously expressed temperature-sensitive GAL80.
As expected, flies at 18ºC eat similar amounts (Fig. 4D, above), but when shifted to 30ºC, flies with less Sptr in their NPF neurons eat more than heterozygous controls (Fig. 4D, below).
In support of the physical distribution of BH4 synthesis as it relates to appetite control, neither the NPF neuron-specific knock-down of _pr_ (Fig. 4E) nor _Pu_ (Fig. S3C) alters feeding amount.

We next asked whether adult NPF-neuron specific over-expression of _Sptr_ rescues the hyperphagia of _Sptr_ mutants.
At 18ºC, flies carrying the _Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>_ mutation eat more than flies lacking this mutation regardless of their remaining genotype (Fig. 4F, above).
Shifting these genotypes to 30ºC post-eclosion causes the _Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>_ mutant flies over-expressing _Sptr_ in their NPF neurons to eat the same as the _w<sup>1118</sup>_ controls and much less than their corresponding heterozygous controls (Fig. 4F, below).
Similar over-expression of _Sptr_ in the NPF neurons of flies in the _w<sup>1118</sup>_ background reduces feeding (Fig. S3D).
