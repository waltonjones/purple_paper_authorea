We next asked whether the role of *Sptr* in appetite regulation is, like that of *Pu* and *pr*, specific to the fat body. 
To our surprise, we were unable to observe any change in feeding upon combining three different Sptr-IR lines with the fat body-specific drivers r4-GAL4 (Fig. 4A) or FB-Gal4 (Fig S1B). 
Since feeding is ultimately directed by the brain, we used the pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 to knock-down *Sptr*. 
Indeed, *Sptr* knock-down in all neurons increases feeding (Fig. 4B and S1C). 
After confirming that pan-neuronal knock-down of *pr* has no effect on feeding (Fig. S1D), we were convinced that the steps in the biosynthesis of the BH4 required for proper appetite control are physically distributed between the fat body and the brain. 
This suggests the intermediate metabolite PTP is circulated, probably via the hemolymph, from its site of origin in the fat to its site of conversion to BH4 in the brain. 

Next, we screened a group of neuronal GAL4 lines in an effort to more precisely define the *Sptr*-positive neurons that regulate feeding (Fig. S2).
*Sptr* knock-down with both the ubiquitous Actin-5C driver (Act5C-GAL4) and the "pan-peptidergic" driver (386Y-GAL4) increase feeding (Fig. S2A--B).
Knock-down of *Sptr* using the broad dopaminergic (TH-GAL4) and serotonergic (Trh-GAL4) drivers as well as the "obesity blocking neuron" driver (c673a-GAL4) \cite{AlAnzi_2009}, the insulin-producing cell driver (dilp2-GAL4), the oenocyte driver (OK72-GAL4), and the feeding related peptidergic neuron drivers sNPF-GAL4 and AstA-GAL4 produce no significant effect on feeding (Fig. S2C--I).
We did observe hyperphagia, however, when we combined a GAL4 driver that labels the small group of neurons that express the neuropeptide NPF with each of three different Sptr-IR lines (Fig. 4C, and S3A--B). 
As expected, this hyperphagia can also be rescued by pre-feeding the flies with a low dose of BH4 (Fig. 4C and S3A). 
To rule out a developmental explanation for this effect, we limited the knock-down of *Sptr* to adult NPF neurons by adding the ubiquitously expressed temperature-sensitive GAL80.
As expected, flies at the permissive temperature (18ºC) eat similar amounts (Fig. 4D, above), but when shifted to the restrictive temperature (30ºC), flies whose NPF neurons lack sufficient *Sptr* eat more than heterozygous controls (Fig. 4D, below). 
In support of the physical distribution of the BH4 synthesis pathway as it relates to appetite control, NPF neuron-specific knock-down of neither *pr* (Fig. 4E) nor *Pu* (Fig. S3C) causes any significant change in feeding behavior.

We next asked whether adult NPF-neuron specific over-expression of *Sptr* could rescue the hyperphagia of *Sptr* mutants. 
At the permissive temperature (18ºC), flies carrying the *Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>* mutation eat more than flies lacking this mutation regardless of their remaining genotype (Fig. 4F, above). 
When flies are transferred to the restrictive temperature (30ºC) post-eclosion, however, *Sptr<sup>f04272</sup>* mutant flies over-expressing *Sptr* in their NPF neurons eat the same as *w<sup>1118</sup>* controls and much less than their corresponding heterozygous controls (Fig. 4F, below). 
Similar over-expression of *Sptr* in the NPF neurons of flies in the *w<sup>1118</sup>* background reduces feeding (Fig. S3D).
